            "“Twitter is re-examining Elon Musk’s $43 billion takeover offer after the billionaire lined up financing for the bid, in a sign the social-media company could be more receptive to a deal,” the Wall Street Journal reports.\n",
            "“Twitter had been expected to rebuff the offer, which Mr. Musk made earlier this month without saying how he would pay for it. But after he disclosed last week that he now has $46.5 billion in financing, Twitter is taking a fresh look at the offer and is more likely than before to seek to negotiate, people familiar with the matter said. The situation is fast-moving and it is still far from guaranteed Twitter will do so.”\n",

            "(Bloomberg) — Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk earned the nickname “Teflon Elon” by successfully fighting off multiple legal challenges. But a recent court ruling suggests his run of personal victories may be endangered.\n",

            "Last week, it was revealed that a San Francisco judge had determined that one of Musk’s 2018 tweets about taking his company private was a lie. \n",
            "It’s one of at least a dozen high-profile cases that Tesla or Musk are involved in years after he posted the infamous “funding secured” tweet, sending shares soaring and inviting the wrath of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n",

            "The judge’s decision tips the scales heavily in favor of Tesla investors who are suing Musk and Tesla for as much as $12 billion in trading losses they blame on the go-private tweets. That case is set for a jury trial in January.\n",
            "The decision also poses a threat to Musk’s effort to unleash himself from oversight by the SEC — a quest so personal for the world’s richest person that he became visibly emotional while lambasting the agency during a TED talk in Canada last week.\n",

            "Securities law experts including Columbia Law School professor Jeffrey Gordon say that being ruled a liar after years of insisting his tweets were truthful will make it harder for the voluble billionaire to wriggle out from underneath the “Twitter Sitter” — the moniker for the arrangement with the SEC that a Tesla official pre-approve what Musk says on social media about certain company-related topics, like production.\n",

            "That was before U.S. District Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco issued his ruling, which remains sealed from public view. \n",
            "Musk is trying to appeal the finding, saying in a filing Friday that the judge “parsed the individual phrases of the various tweets and indicated certain other information should have accompanied the tweets, even though the short-form Twitter medium limits the number of characters per tweet.”\n",
            "Musk’s lawyer, Alex Spiro, didn’t respond to a request for comment on the SEC fight, which is ongoing in New York. But his response to Chen’s ruling on April 16 was defiant.\n",

            "Going forward, the challenge facing the SEC is how to regulate high-profile public figures like Musk with millions of Twitter followers, with these VIPs knowing the potential impact of their statements on capital markets, said Jill E.

            "In the San Francisco case, Bloomberg Intelligence estimated before Chen issued his ruling that the lawsuit could settle for between $260 million and $380 million.\n",
            "“The price of settlement just went way up,” said Adam C. Pritchard, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School. Chen’s ruling was a “huge win” for shareholders and an appeal of the decision by Musk “might be hard to come by,” he said. \n",
            "Nicholas Porritt, a lawyer representing shareholders, said he expects Chen’s ruling will become public in the next few days. \n",
            "Chen’s decision means that Musk won’t be able to argue to jurors that some key statements in his tweets were true, or that he didn’t act fraudulently when he made them, Porritt said.\n",
            "A pretrial ruling that so thoroughly discredits a defendant in a securities fraud case is “very rare,” Porritt said. “Certainly it has not been obtained in any case of similar size to this one.”\n",

            "Twitter Inc. TWTR 3.93% is re-examining Elon Musk’s $43 billion takeover offer after the billionaire lined up financing for the bid, in a sign the social-media company could be more receptive to a deal.\n",
            "Twitter had been expected to rebuff the offer, which Mr. Musk made earlier this month without saying how he would pay for it. But after he disclosed last week that he now has $46.5 billion in financing, Twitter is taking a fresh look at the offer and is more likely than before to seek to negotiate, people familiar with the matter said. The situation is fast-moving and it is still far from guaranteed Twitter will do so.\n",
            "Twitter is still working on an all-important estimate of its own value, which would need to come in close to Mr. Musk’s offer, and it could also insist on sweeteners such as Mr. Musk agreeing to cover breakup protections should the deal fall apart, some of the people said.\n",

Twitter’s response won’t necessarily be black-and-white, and could leave the door open for inviting other bidders or negotiating with Mr. Musk on terms other than price. Mr. Musk reiterated to Twitter’s chairman Bret Taylor in recent days that he won’t budge from his offer of $54.20-a-share, the people said.\n",

            "The potential turnabout on Twitter’s part comes after Mr. Musk met privately Friday with several shareholders of the company to extol the virtues of his proposal while repeating that the board has a “yes-or-no” decision to make, according to people familiar with the matter. He also pledged to solve the free-speech issues he sees as plaguing the platform and the country more broadly, whether his bid succeeds or not, they said.\n",
            "The Tesla Inc. TSLA -0.37% chief executive made his pitch to select shareholders in a series of video calls, with a focus on actively managed funds, the people said, in hopes that they could sway the company’s decision.\n",
            "Mr. Musk said he sees no way Twitter management can get the stock to his offer price on its own, given the issues in the business and a persistent inability to correct them. It couldn’t be learned if he detailed specific steps he would take, though he has tweeted about wanting to reduce the platform’s reliance on advertising, as well as to make simpler changes such as allowing longer tweets.\n",
            "Mr. Musk already has some shareholders rallying behind him following the meetings. Lauri Brunner, who manages Thrivent Asset Management LLC’s large-cap growth fund, sees Mr. Musk as a skilled operator. “He has an established track record at Tesla,” she said. “He is the catalyst to deliver strong operating performance at Twitter.” Minneapolis-based Thrivent has a roughly 0.4% stake in Twitter worth $160 million and is also a Tesla shareholder.\n",
            "Mr. Musk already has said he is considering taking his bid directly to shareholders by launching a tender offer. Even if he was to get significant shareholder support in a tender offer—which is far from guaranteed—he would still need a way around the company’s poison pill, a legal maneuver it employed that effectively blocks him from building his stake to 15% or more.\n",

            "One oft-employed tactic to push a bid, seeking to gain control of the target’s board, is out of reach for now. Twitter’s directors have staggered terms, meaning a dissident shareholder would need multiple years to gain control rather than a single shareholder vote. Twitter tried last year to phase out the staggered board terms given that they are frowned upon by the corporate-governance community, but not enough shareholders voted on the measure. The company is attempting to do so again at this year’s annual meeting set for May 25. Only two directors are up for re-election, and it is too late for Mr. Musk to nominate his own.\n",
            "Twitter’s shares have been trading below his offer price since he made the bid April 14, typically a sign that shareholders are skeptical a deal will happen, though they did close up roughly 4% Friday at $48.93, the day after he unveiled financing for the deal. He has indicated that if the current bid fails, he could sell his stake, of more than 9%.\n",
            "The financing included more than $25 billion in debt coming from nearly every global blue-chip investment bank aside from the two advising Twitter. The remainder was $21 billion in equity Mr. Musk would provide himself, likely by selling existing stakes in his other businesses such as Tesla. The speed at which the financing came together and the market selloff in recent days—which makes the all-cash offer look relatively more attractive—likely contributed to Twitter’s greater willingness to entertain Mr. Musk’s proposal.\n",

The firm last bought Twitter shares in February and owns about 950,000 overall, which accounts for about 11% of its portfolio.\n",
            "Mr. Gramm said Twitter’s board can’t walk away from Mr. Musk’s offer without providing an alternative that gives real value to shareholders. “I’m not sure what that can be at this stage besides finding a higher bid,” he said.\n",

Musk pushed back again Tuesday against a lawsuit that blames him for engineering Tesla’s 2016 acquisition of a financially precarious company called SolarCity that was marred by conflicts of interest and never generated the profits Musk insisted it would.

            "In the apparent text message exchange, Musk inquired if Gates still had a half-billion-dollar short position on Tesla. Gates said he had not closed out and said he wanted to discuss \"philanthropy possibilities,\" but Musk shut down the conversation. “Sorry, I cannot take your philanthropy on climate change seriously when you have a massive short position against Tesla, the company doing the most to solve climate change,\" Musk said, according to the screenshot.\n",

            "For some, Musk’s bid has stoked hopes that Twitter will be taken private in order to address its perceived failure to innovate and find new revenue streams, even if many do not see Musk as the man for the job. It has also shined a spotlight on Twitter’s checkered history of sluggish innovation, technical shortcomings and leadership infighting.\n",

            "“Twitter has been developed to a fraction of its full potential,” said one former board member. “God yes, it should go private. There is a world where I can imagine the business is 10 to 100 times bigger.”\n",
            "The board is “caught in-between not enough value in Musk’s bid but maybe not enough ability to realize the greater value themselves,” said one tech investor, who does not have a position in Twitter.\n",
            "Twitter has grown at a far slower clip than social media peers including Facebook and LinkedIn, and has been less profitable. In 2020, it drew the scrutiny of an activist investor, Elliott Management, over concerns that its co-founder and then-chief executive Jack Dorsey was too freewheeling and indecisive.\n",
            "Analysts and advertisers have criticized Dorsey for being a Twitter purist too focused on small tweaks to the core product, while failing to aggressively seek ways to boost its advertising offering and diversify revenues beyond ads, to areas such as subscriptions.\n",
            "“Here’s a company that has so much potential and keeps squandering it. You’ve almost got a whole PhD thesis on missed opportunities,” said one advertising agency executive, adding that Twitter had failed to capitalize on areas such as short-form video, ratings and reviews, and news.\n",

            "Twitter Inc. TWTR 3.93% is re-examining Elon Musk’s $43 billion takeover offer after the billionaire lined up financing for the bid, in a sign the social-media company could be more receptive to a deal.\n",
            "Twitter had been expected to rebuff the offer, which Mr. Musk made earlier this month without saying how he would pay for it. But after he disclosed last week that he now has $46.5 billion in financing, Twitter is taking a fresh look at the offer and is more likely than before to seek to negotiate, people familiar with the matter said. The situation is fast-moving and it is still far from guaranteed Twitter will do so.\n",
            "Twitter is still working on an all-important estimate of its own value, which would need to come in close to Mr. Musk’s offer, and it could also insist on sweeteners such as Mr. Musk agreeing to cover breakup protections should the deal fall apart, some of the people said.\n",
            "The two sides are meeting Sunday to discuss Mr. Musk’s proposal, the people said.\n",

            "PAUL SAKUMA/ASSOCIATED PRESS\n",
            "Twitter is expected to weigh in on the bid when it reports first-quarter earnings Thursday, if not sooner, the people said. Twitter’s response won’t necessarily be black-and-white, and could leave the door open for inviting other bidders or negotiating with Mr. Musk on terms other than price. Mr. Musk reiterated to Twitter’s chairman Bret Taylor in recent days that he won’t budge from his offer of $54.20-a-share, the people said.\n",
            "The potential turnabout on Twitter’s part comes after Mr. Musk met privately Friday with several shareholders of the company to extol the virtues of his proposal while repeating that the board has a “yes-or-no” decision to make, according to people familiar with the matter. He also pledged to solve the free-speech issues he sees as plaguing the platform and the country more broadly, whether his bid succeeds or not, they said.\n",
            "The Tesla Inc. TSLA -0.37% chief executive made his pitch to select shareholders in a series of video calls, with a focus on actively managed funds, the people said, in hopes that they could sway the company’s decision.\n",
            "Mr. Musk said he sees no way Twitter management can get the stock to his offer price on its own, given the issues in the business and a persistent inability to correct them. It couldn’t be learned if he detailed specific steps he would take, though he has tweeted about wanting to reduce the platform’s reliance on advertising, as well as to make simpler changes such as allowing longer tweets.\n",
            "Mr. Musk already has some shareholders rallying behind him following the meetings. Lauri Brunner, who manages Thrivent Asset Management LLC’s large-cap growth fund, sees Mr. Musk as a skilled operator. “He has an established track record at Tesla,” she said. “He is the catalyst to deliver strong operating performance at Twitter.” Minneapolis-based Thrivent has a roughly 0.4% stake in Twitter worth $160 million and is also a Tesla shareholder.\n",
            "Mr. Musk already has said he is considering taking his bid directly to shareholders by launching a tender offer. Even if he was to get significant shareholder support in a tender offer—which is far from guaranteed—he would still need a way around the company’s poison pill, a legal maneuver it employed that effectively blocks him from building his stake to 15% or more.\n",

            "PHOTO: MIGUEL ROBERTS/THE BROWNSVILLE HERALD/ASSOCIATED PRESS\n",
            "One oft-employed tactic to push a bid, seeking to gain control of the target’s board, is out of reach for now. Twitter’s directors have staggered terms, meaning a dissident shareholder would need multiple years to gain control rather than a single shareholder vote. Twitter tried last year to phase out the staggered board terms given that they are frowned upon by the corporate-governance community, but not enough shareholders voted on the measure. The company is attempting to do so again at this year’s annual meeting set for May 25. Only two directors are up for re-election, and it is too late for Mr. Musk to nominate his own.\n",
            "Twitter’s shares have been trading below his offer price since he made the bid April 14, typically a sign that shareholders are skeptical a deal will happen, though they did close up roughly 4% Friday at $48.93, the day after he unveiled financing for the deal. He has indicated that if the current bid fails, he could sell his stake, of more than 9%.\n",
            "The financing included more than $25 billion in debt coming from nearly every global blue-chip investment bank aside from the two advising Twitter. The remainder was $21 billion in equity Mr. Musk would provide himself, likely by selling existing stakes in his other businesses such as Tesla. The speed at which the financing came together and the market selloff in recent days—which makes the all-cash offer look relatively more attractive—likely contributed to Twitter’s greater willingness to entertain Mr. Musk’s proposal.\n",

            "Twitter’s board should engage with Mr. Musk since its stock has “gone nowhere” since the company went public eight years ago, said Jeff Gramm, a portfolio manager with Bandera Partners LLC, a New York hedge fund with about $385 million under management. The firm last bought Twitter shares in February and owns about 950,000 overall, which accounts for about 11% of its portfolio.\n",

            "Twitter is rethinking mega-troll Elon Musk’s $43 billion offer to take over the company, The Wall Street Journal reports. The company had planned to push its largest shareholder to the side after he first announced plans to buy the company, but after he said he had nearly $50 billion in financing, Twitter became more receptive to a conversation. The company has not commented publicly on Musk’s proposal since its initial announcement saying he would not join its board, though it plans to make its first statement on it by Thursday at the latest when it announces its first-quarter results. Musk’s offer isn’t expected to be the only one the company considers as it contemplates buyers, but the company plans to hear Musk’s team out on Sunday, according to the Journal.\n",

Randy Bishop, who goes by “Trucker Randy,” made the comments on his March 31 radio show, perpetuating the racist argument that the media is controlled by Black Americans who seek to raise issues of voter suppression while somehow suppressing white Americans. “Can’t even watch a college basketball tournament without commercials telling me I have to feel guilty because I think a family should be a white mom, a white dad, and white kids,” he said. “They want us to die and go away. And they’re going to try to do it through politics this year. Well, we have got to be just as smart.” His comments on Black Americans were even starker: “Why are we allowing such a small percentage of our population to control our society? Because they own the media. Because they own the politicians. Because they own the public schools.”\n",

            "Elon Musk on Saturday took a potshot at fellow billionaire Bill Gates’s belly with a crude tweet as part of his escalating feud with the Microsoft co-founder.\n",
            "Mr Musk, the world’s richest man with an estimated worth near $300bn (£233bn), tweeted a photo of Mr Gates alongside a picture of a pregnant man emoji, captioning the post: “in case u need to lose a boner fast.”\n",
            "The tweet followed the Tesla mogul’s apparent confirmation that leaked screenshots of a conversation between himself and Mr Gates were, in fact, authentic. He wrote on Twitter – which he’s trying to buy – that he had not personally leaked the tweets and media must have obtained them from “friends of friends”.\n",
            "In the text conversation, the billionaires appear to be making a plan to meet before Mr Musk asks Mr Gates: “Do you still have a half billion dollar short position against Tesla?”\n",

            "“Sorry, but I cannot take your philanthropy on climate change seriously when you have a massive short position against Tesla, the company doing the most to solve climate change,” Mr Musk retorts.\n",
            "The SpaceX founder, who is no stranger to controversy – rather, the opposite – has previously butted heads with Mr Gates over a variety of topics.\n",
            "Coronavirus was a major sticking point between the two, who were both involved in efforts to combat the pandemic, but Mr Gates told CNBC in 2020: “Elon’s positioning is to maintain a high level of outrageous comments.\n",
            "“He’s not much involved in vaccines. He makes a great electric car. And his rockets work well. So he’s allowed to say these things. I hope that he doesn’t confuse areas he’s not involved in too much.”\n",
            "When it comes to electric vehicles, however, Mr Musk tweeted that his sometime rival had “no clue” and his conversations with Mr Gates had “been underwhelming tbh”.\n",
            "Both men have endured a volatile several years, aside from the pandemic and their personal feuds. Mr Musk got in trouble with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and in 2018 had to step down as chairman of Tesla, his own company; he had two children with singer Grimes who were given the impossible, headline-grabbing names of X Æ A-12 and Exa Dark Sideræl; and is currently embroiled in an attempt to purchase and overhaul Twitter.\n",

            "Twitter had been expected to rebuff the offer, which Mr. Musk made earlier this month without saying how he would pay for it. But after he disclosed last week that he now has $46.5 billion in financing, Twitter is taking a fresh look at the offer and is more likely than before to seek to negotiate, people familiar with the matter said. The situation is fast-moving and it is still far from guaranteed Twitter will do so.\n",
            "Twitter is still working on an all-important estimate of its own value, which would need to come in close to Mr. Musk’s offer, and it could also insist on sweeteners such as Mr. Musk agreeing to cover breakup protections should the deal fall apart, some of the people said.\n",

Twitter’s response won’t necessarily be black-and-white, and could leave the door open for inviting other bidders or negotiating with Mr. Musk on terms other than price. Mr. Musk reiterated to Twitter’s chairman Bret Taylor in recent days that he won’t budge from his offer of $54.20-a-share, the people said.\n",

            "The potential turnabout on Twitter’s part comes after Mr. Musk met privately Friday with several shareholders of the company to extol the virtues of his proposal while repeating that the board has a “yes-or-no” decision to make, according to people familiar with the matter. He also pledged to solve the free-speech issues he sees as plaguing the platform and the country more broadly, whether his bid succeeds or not, they said.\n",
            "The Tesla Inc. TSLA -0.37% chief executive made his pitch to select shareholders in a series of video calls, with a focus on actively managed funds, the people said, in hopes that they could sway the company’s decision.\n",
            "Mr. Musk said he sees no way Twitter management can get the stock to his offer price on its own, given the issues in the business and a persistent inability to correct them. It couldn’t be learned if he detailed specific steps he would take, though he has tweeted about wanting to reduce the platform’s reliance on advertising, as well as to make simpler changes such as allowing longer tweets.\n",
            "Mr. Musk already has some shareholders rallying behind him following the meetings. Lauri Brunner, who manages Thrivent Asset Management LLC’s large-cap growth fund, sees Mr. Musk as a skilled operator. “He has an established track record at Tesla,” she said. “He is the catalyst to deliver strong operating performance at Twitter.” Minneapolis-based Thrivent has a roughly 0.4% stake in Twitter worth $160 million and is also a Tesla shareholder.\n",
            "Mr. Musk already has said he is considering taking his bid directly to shareholders by launching a tender offer. Even if he was to get significant shareholder support in a tender offer—which is far from guaranteed—he would still need a way around the company’s poison pill, a legal maneuver it employed that effectively blocks him from building his stake to 15% or more.\n",

            "One oft-employed tactic to push a bid, seeking to gain control of the target’s board, is out of reach for now. Twitter’s directors have staggered terms, meaning a dissident shareholder would need multiple years to gain control rather than a single shareholder vote. Twitter tried last year to phase out the staggered board terms given that they are frowned upon by the corporate-governance community, but not enough shareholders voted on the measure. The company is attempting to do so again at this year’s annual meeting set for May 25. Only two directors are up for re-election, and it is too late for Mr. Musk to nominate his own.\n",
            "Twitter’s shares have been trading below his offer price since he made the bid April 14, typically a sign that shareholders are skeptical a deal will happen, though they did close up roughly 4% Friday at $48.93, the day after he unveiled financing for the deal. He has indicated that if the current bid fails, he could sell his stake, of more than 9%.\n",
            "The financing included more than $25 billion in debt coming from nearly every global blue-chip investment bank aside from the two advising Twitter. The remainder was $21 billion in equity Mr. Musk would provide himself, likely by selling existing stakes in his other businesses such as Tesla. The speed at which the financing came together and the market selloff in recent days—which makes the all-cash offer look relatively more attractive—likely contributed to Twitter’s greater willingness to entertain Mr. Musk’s proposal.\n",

The firm last bought Twitter shares in February and owns about 950,000 overall, which accounts for about 11% of its portfolio.\n",

            "In a recent TED interview obtained by TMZ, one of the richest men on Earth can be seen trying to jump through some serious mental hoops to defend his billions.\n",
            "In what appears to be an attempt at making him look less evil, Musk said that having a ridiculously large fortune all that isn't that bad, particularly when you don't actually use the money on yourself.\n",
            "Yeah, you read that right. According to him, people have it all wrong, because he doesn't live like a regular billionaire and spend his fortune on stuff like luxury items and lavish getaways.\n",
            "“I don't have yacht, I don’t take vacations, so it's not that my personal consumption is high,\" Musk insisted. \"One exception is a plane but if I don't use the plane I have less hours to work.”\n",
            "Not only that, but Musk went on to tell the interviewer that he doesn't own a house, even near Tesla HQ in San Francisco or the SpaceX site in Texas, where he did previously live in a 375 square foot spot. So then where does he sleep if he's ostensibly ditched his apartment? Well, just like a touring indie band, it turns out he relies on his friends.\n",
            "That's right, the guy who is now the majority owner of Twitter is a couch surfer with a penchant for staying in other peoples' guest rooms. And he apparently thinks that's what makes him an unproblematic rich person, especially since he believes his money is mostly going towards his companies and projects that, ultimately, benefit mankind.\n",
            "“I think there’s some axiomatic flaws that are leading to that conclusion,\" Musk said of the assumption that all billionaires are bad. \"If, for sure it would be problematic if I was consuming billions of dollars of year in personal consumption but that is not the case.\"\n",

His sold-out stand, which is being taped for a special, is one of numerous highlights of Netflix Is a Joke: The Festival, a star-studded, citywide cavalcade of comedy that launches Thursday, with a preview night Wednesday. The 12-day festival is a presentation by the streaming giant, which in recent years has become a dominant force in the comedy universe.\n",
            "The sprawling lineup is crammed with elite entertainers, including Dave Chappelle, Kevin Hart, Amy Schumer, Hasan Minhaj, Amy Poehler, Larry David, Lil Rel Howery, Seth Rogen, Bill Burr, Patton Oswalt, Pete Davidson, Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin. The Hollywood Bowl, Crypto.com Arena, the Kia Forum, the Hollywood Palladium, the Wiltern and the Laugh Factory are among the venues.\n",
            "It’s an even larger realization of the event first planned for 2020 but postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
            "“We had worked with so much amazing talent, and we wanted to have a celebration of comedy,” said Robbie Praw, vice president of stand-up and comedy formats for Netflix. “Two years later, this thing has taken on a different meaning. Now it’s about people in Los Angeles finally getting out and being able to laugh and have a good time together. It’s also the first time in a long time that these comedians will be together.”\n",
            "Alongside all the A-listers, the appearance by Southern California native Iglesias stands out as a milestone, both for him and for Dodger Stadium.\n",

            "Primarily, it’s been iconic artists such as Elton John, Paul McCartney, Billy Joel, the Three Tenors and Simon & Garfunkel who have played (and easily filled) the 56,000-seat ballpark. And even for a comedian who’s drawn capacity crowds at Madison Square Garden and the Sydney Opera House, the idea of playing the L.A. landmark is a bit daunting.\n",
            "“It’s still not real,” Iglesias said as he sat high up in the stadium near the press box in late March, accompanied by an entourage and his two chihuahua pups, Vinnie and Risa. He was in Fluffy garb — a beret, spacious Hawaiian shirt, shorts and sneakers.\n",
            "“This was a huge gamble — it’s the biggest place ever I’ve performed,” he added. “I’m usually very comfortable onstage, but I know this will have a bit of a different element to it. This will give me chills. But I’m not really scared of the performance. I’ve been doing this a long time.”\n",
            "He also feels it’s an appropriate setting to mark his 25th year in show business. He started out playing dives and garages in his home base of Long Beach. “Five years ago, I played Staples Center, and I thought at that time, where do I go from here?” Iglesias said. “Dodger Stadium is a great way to celebrate 25 years. A good, solid number.”\n",
            "After selling out the May 7 date, Iglesias added a May 6 show titled “Fluffy on the Field,” which will be a bit more intimate, with seating only on the field.\n",

There’s a very small list of comedians that could pull that off, since it’s never been done before. The first person we called was Gabe. He has roots in the community, and we think of this as a real homecoming. There’s something innate about his energy and the energy he brings out in his crowds that makes it a perfect fit for this historical moment in comedy.\n",
            "“I’ve been working in this business for about 18 years,” Praw added, “and I’ve thrown a lot of shows. I once worked with Gabe at the Sydney Opera House. To this day, it was the loudest I’ve ever heard a crowd be for a comedy show. To pull off a show at Dodger Stadium, you need to be an artist that can marshal that kind of energy and excitement.”\n",
            "No one keeping tabs on Iglesias’ momentum would be surprised that he’s reached superstar status. Among Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, he’s amassed 9.2 million followers. Forbes placed him sixth — the most recent figures available — on its 2019 list of highest-earning comedians, with $22 million. When he reprises a familiar bit at his concerts, fans will chime in with the punchline. Chris Rock has called him the “King of the Mexicans.”\n",

            "Iglesias’ popularity has been fueled by YouTube videos and voice performances in animated films such as “Coco” and “Space Jam: A New Legacy,” along with his projects on Netflix: “Mr. Iglesias,” a sitcom in which he plays a high school teacher, and particularly his stand-up specials, “One Show Fits All” and “I’m Sorry for What I Said When I Was Hungry.”\n",
            "Those specials showcase his down-to-earth persona, with Iglesias bantering with folks in the audience as if they were old friends. Topics are wide-ranging — his love for Red Lobster biscuits, debating whether Marvel superheroes are better than DC superheroes and what it’s like to smoke a huge blunt with Snoop Dogg. Family members are also a key focus, especially his girlfriend and his young son, Frankie.\n",
            "Gabriel Iglesias on the field.(Jay L. Clendenin / Los Angeles Times)\n",
            "He can also earn a tear or two. A key portion of “One Show Fits All” features his hilarious yet poignant account of his mother meeting Mexican singing legend Vicente Fernández backstage at a concert.\n",
            "Asked about his connection to fans, Iglesias paused for a moment. It was a few days after the Oscars, when Will Smith’s attack on Chris Rock during the ceremony ignited a massive uproar.\n",
            "“It’s being vulnerable,” he finally said. “I let the audience know, Yes, this is working, but I’m not above you. I realize this can go away with one bad tweet, one bad comment, or if you slap someone’s face. People appreciate it when you take the time to tell them you appreciate them being there. It doesn’t take a lot to acknowledge that you’re grateful.”\n",
            "He also addressed the outsize impact of comedy in the current charged political and social environments.\n",
            "“Comedy has become a double-edged sword,” Iglesias said. “It’s bigger than it’s ever been, but at the same time, you’re limited in what you can say. Go back and look at those comedians in the TV specials in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s. There was nothing that could not be said onstage. There was no social media, no internet. Now, you can blast everything to an entire planet. I know without that, my career would not be where it’s at.\n",
            "“I made a decision early on that I would do a show that you could bring your family to. People can bring their children, their grandparents. No ruffling of feathers. Have an opinion, but keep it light. Keep it friendly. Keep it fluffy.”\n",

            "“To have a whole year off — I’m not going to lie — I started to get nervous because I started to get comfortable,” he said. “It was the longest break I’ve ever taken. I don’t take vacations. I’m always on the road. Then it became, I love sleeping in, the dogs are happy, I can eat what I want. And that was scary.”\n",

Some stuff about COVID — the pros and cons. More cons than pros.”\n",

            "“Well, the word ‘retirement’ actually came up at one point,” Iglesias said. “If this special is the greatest thing ever, maybe we’ll do another one. Maybe a tour of football stadiums. Who knows? Maybe Elon Musk will call and say, ‘You want to go to space and tell some jokes?’”\n",

            "Twitter had been expected to rebuff the offer, which Mr. Musk made earlier this month without saying how he would pay for it. But after he disclosed last week that he now has $46.5 billion in financing, Twitter is taking a fresh look at the offer and is more likely than before to seek to negotiate, people familiar with the matter said. The situation is fast-moving and it is still far from guaranteed Twitter will do so.\n",
            "Twitter is still working on an all-important estimate of its own value, which would need to come in close to Mr. Musk’s offer, and it could also insist on sweeteners such as Mr. Musk agreeing to cover breakup protections should the deal fall apart, some of the people said.\n",

            "Twitter is expected to weigh in on the bid when it reports first-quarter earnings Thursday, if not sooner, the people said. Twitter’s response won’t necessarily be black-and-white, and could leave the door open for inviting other bidders or negotiating with Mr. Musk on terms other than price. Mr. Musk reiterated to Twitter’s chairman Bret Taylor in recent days that he won’t budge from his offer of $54.20-a-share, the people said.\n",

            "The potential turnabout on Twitter’s part comes after Mr. Musk met privately Friday with several shareholders of the company to extol the virtues of his proposal while repeating that the board has a “yes-or-no” decision to make, according to people familiar with the matter. He also pledged to solve the free-speech issues he sees as plaguing the platform and the country more broadly, whether his bid succeeds or not, they said.\n",
            "The Tesla Inc. TSLA -0.37% chief executive made his pitch to select shareholders in a series of video calls, with a focus on actively managed funds, the people said, in hopes that they could sway the company’s decision.\n",
            "Mr. Musk said he sees no way Twitter management can get the stock to his offer price on its own, given the issues in the business and a persistent inability to correct them. It couldn’t be learned if he detailed specific steps he would take, though he has tweeted about wanting to reduce the platform’s reliance on advertising, as well as to make simpler changes such as allowing longer tweets.\n",
            "Mr. Musk already has some shareholders rallying behind him following the meetings. Lauri Brunner, who manages Thrivent Asset Management LLC’s large-cap growth fund, sees Mr. Musk as a skilled operator. “He has an established track record at Tesla,” she said. “He is the catalyst to deliver strong operating performance at Twitter.” Minneapolis-based Thrivent has a roughly 0.4% stake in Twitter worth $160 million and is also a Tesla shareholder.\n",
            "Mr. Musk already has said he is considering taking his bid directly to shareholders by launching a tender offer. Even if he was to get significant shareholder support in a tender offer—which is far from guaranteed—he would still need a way around the company’s poison pill, a legal maneuver it employed that effectively blocks him from building his stake to 15% or more.\n",

            "One oft-employed tactic to push a bid, seeking to gain control of the target’s board, is out of reach for now. Twitter’s directors have staggered terms, meaning a dissident shareholder would need multiple years to gain control rather than a single shareholder vote. Twitter tried last year to phase out the staggered board terms given that they are frowned upon by the corporate-governance community, but not enough shareholders voted on the measure. The company is attempting to do so again at this year’s annual meeting set for May 25. Only two directors are up for re-election, and it is too late for Mr. Musk to nominate his own.\n",
            "Twitter’s shares have been trading below his offer price since he made the bid April 14, typically a sign that shareholders are skeptical a deal will happen, though they did close up roughly 4% Friday at $48.93, the day after he unveiled financing for the deal. He has indicated that if the current bid fails, he could sell his stake, of more than 9%.\n",
            "The financing included more than $25 billion in debt coming from nearly every global blue-chip investment bank aside from the two advising Twitter. The remainder was $21 billion in equity Mr. Musk would provide himself, likely by selling existing stakes in his other businesses such as Tesla. The speed at which the financing came together and the market selloff in recent days—which makes the all-cash offer look relatively more attractive—likely contributed to Twitter’s greater willingness to entertain Mr. Musk’s proposal.\n",

            "Twitter’s board should engage with Mr. Musk since its stock has “gone nowhere” since the company went public eight years ago, said Jeff Gramm, a portfolio manager with Bandera Partners LLC, a New York hedge fund with about $385 million under management. The firm last bought Twitter shares in February and owns about 950,000 overall, which accounts for about 11% of its portfolio.\n",
            "Mr. Gramm said Twitter’s board can’t walk away from Mr. Musk’s offer without providing an alternative that gives real value to shareholders. “I’m not sure what that can be at this stage besides finding a higher bid,” he said.\n",

            "Twitter is re-examining Elon Musk's unsolicited offer to buy the company and take it private, The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday. The two sides are meeting Sunday to discuss Musk's proposal, the Journal reported, suggesting that the social media company might be receptive to Musk's offer.\n",
            "Musk proposed paying $54.20 for each share of the influential social media company, an offer that values Twitter at $43 billion. The entrepreneur, who runs Tesla, SpaceX and other companies, already owns more than 9% of Twitter. \n",
            "Twitter had widely been expected to reject the offer, adopting a limited-duration shareholders rights plan, a tactic known as the \"poison pill\" defense that's used by companies to fend off takeover attempts like the one facing Twitter. Poison pills make it difficult for a potential buyer to acquire a majority of a company's shares by making more of them available. \n",
            "Twitter is also expected to discuss Musk offer when it reports first-quarter earnings Thursday, sources told the Journal.\n",
            "Musk has publicly raised questions about Twitter's future, repeatedly polling his 81 million followers about changes that could be made at the company, which lags competitors Facebook, TikTok and Instagram in users and engagement.\n",
            "Musk has called the offer his \"best and final,\" adding in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that \"If the deal doesn't work, given that I don't have confidence in management nor do I believe I can drive the necessary change in the public market, I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder.\"\n",

            "Twitter Inc. TWTR 3.93% is re-examining Elon Musk’s $43 billion takeover offer after the billionaire lined up financing for the bid, in a sign the social-media company could be more receptive to a deal.\n",
            "Twitter had been expected to rebuff the offer, which Mr. Musk made earlier this month without saying how he would pay for it. But after he disclosed last week that he now has $46.5 billion in financing, Twitter is taking a fresh look at the offer and is more likely than before to seek to negotiate, people familiar with the matter said. The situation is fast-moving and it is still far from guaranteed Twitter will do so.\n",
            "Twitter is still working on an all-important estimate of its own value, which would need to come in close to Mr. Musk’s offer, and it could also insist on sweeteners such as Mr. Musk agreeing to cover breakup protections should the deal fall apart, some of the people said.\n",

            "PAUL SAKUMA/ASSOCIATED PRESS\n",
            "Twitter is expected to weigh in on the bid when it reports first-quarter earnings Thursday, if not sooner, the people said. Twitter’s response won’t necessarily be black-and-white, and could leave the door open for inviting other bidders or negotiating with Mr. Musk on terms other than price. Mr. Musk reiterated to Twitter’s chairman Bret Taylor in recent days that he won’t budge from his offer of $54.20-a-share, the people said.\n",
            "The potential turnabout on Twitter’s part comes after Mr. Musk met privately Friday with several shareholders of the company to extol the virtues of his proposal while repeating that the board has a “yes-or-no” decision to make, according to people familiar with the matter. He also pledged to solve the free-speech issues he sees as plaguing the platform and the country more broadly, whether his bid succeeds or not, they said.\n",
            "The Tesla Inc. TSLA -0.37% chief executive made his pitch to select shareholders in a series of video calls, with a focus on actively managed funds, the people said, in hopes that they could sway the company’s decision.\n",
            "Mr. Musk said he sees no way Twitter management can get the stock to his offer price on its own, given the issues in the business and a persistent inability to correct them. It couldn’t be learned if he detailed specific steps he would take, though he has tweeted about wanting to reduce the platform’s reliance on advertising, as well as to make simpler changes such as allowing longer tweets.\n",
            "Mr. Musk already has some shareholders rallying behind him following the meetings. Lauri Brunner, who manages Thrivent Asset Management LLC’s large-cap growth fund, sees Mr. Musk as a skilled operator. “He has an established track record at Tesla,” she said. “He is the catalyst to deliver strong operating performance at Twitter.” Minneapolis-based Thrivent has a roughly 0.4% stake in Twitter worth $160 million and is also a Tesla shareholder.\n",
            "Mr. Musk already has said he is considering taking his bid directly to shareholders by launching a tender offer. Even if he was to get significant shareholder support in a tender offer—which is far from guaranteed—he would still need a way around the company’s poison pill, a legal maneuver it employed that effectively blocks him from building his stake to 15% or more.\n",

            "PHOTO: MIGUEL ROBERTS/THE BROWNSVILLE HERALD/ASSOCIATED PRESS\n",
            "One oft-employed tactic to push a bid, seeking to gain control of the target’s board, is out of reach for now. Twitter’s directors have staggered terms, meaning a dissident shareholder would need multiple years to gain control rather than a single shareholder vote. Twitter tried last year to phase out the staggered board terms given that they are frowned upon by the corporate-governance community, but not enough shareholders voted on the measure. The company is attempting to do so again at this year’s annual meeting set for May 25. Only two directors are up for re-election, and it is too late for Mr. Musk to nominate his own.\n",
            "Twitter’s shares have been trading below his offer price since he made the bid April 14, typically a sign that shareholders are skeptical a deal will happen, though they did close up roughly 4% Friday at $48.93, the day after he unveiled financing for the deal. He has indicated that if the current bid fails, he could sell his stake, of more than 9%.\n",
            "The financing included more than $25 billion in debt coming from nearly every global blue-chip investment bank aside from the two advising Twitter. The remainder was $21 billion in equity Mr. Musk would provide himself, likely by selling existing stakes in his other businesses such as Tesla. The speed at which the financing came together and the market selloff in recent days—which makes the all-cash offer look relatively more attractive—likely contributed to Twitter’s greater willingness to entertain Mr. Musk’s proposal.\n",

            "Twitter’s board should engage with Mr. Musk since its stock has “gone nowhere” since the company went public eight years ago, said Jeff Gramm, a portfolio manager with Bandera Partners LLC, a New York hedge fund with about $385 million under management. The firm last bought Twitter shares in February and owns about 950,000 overall, which accounts for about 11% of its portfolio.\n",
            "Mr. Gramm said Twitter’s board can’t walk away from Mr. Musk’s offer without providing an alternative that gives real value to shareholders. “I’m not sure what that can be at this stage besides finding a higher bid,” he said.\n",

Then we entered a cavernous hangar with rockets — yes, actual space rockets — in various stages of construction all around us. Our tour guide, Musk himself, was overflowing with child-like excitement about everything that was happening.\n",
            "Except this was no juvenile hobby. It was the headquarters of a multibillion-dollar business that would soon win its first contract with the U.S. space agency Nasa and eventually supplant Nasa as America’s — and the world’s — top space exploration pioneer.\n",
            "The company was SpaceX (short for Space Exploration Technologies), founded by Elon Musk in 2002 (when he was 30 years old) with the $176 million he made from the sale of a previous venture he was involved in, PayPal. Astonishingly, Musk taught himself rocket science in order to start SpaceX.\n",

            "Whether it is exploring space so humans can live on other planets and preserve Earth, pioneering electric cars for the mass market or ending traffic jams, Musk genuinely sees his role as solving mankind’s problems through business\n",
            "Perhaps even more astonishingly, to get to the SpaceX headquarters we drove past the design centre for an electric car company few people outside California had even heard of at the time: Tesla. Also founded by Elon Musk.\n",
            "This was in 2013. Our meeting had been arranged by my friend and former Downing Street colleague Rohan Silva, to see if Musk had any useful observations on government transport policy in the UK.\n",
            "Indeed he did.\n",
            "‘Why on earth are you guys still talking about building high-speed rail? It’s such old technology. You’re crazy!’ he said.\n",
            "He railed — apologies for the pun — against the cost of traditional railway construction, explaining that he had been developing alternatives that could achieve much better results for a fraction of the cost.\n",
            "He told us about his plans for a ‘hyperloop’ — an ultra-high-speed transport system that would enable ‘pods’ of passengers to travel through a vacuum tube at speeds of over 600 mph on magnetic tracks.\n",
            "A few years later, as a guest on the BBC’s Question Time, I mentioned Elon Musk’s hyperloop idea in response to an audience member’s question about the latest costly bureaucratic delay to hit the HS2 project.\n",
            "I remember the merciless mockery directed at me by fellow panellist Ed Miliband for bringing my ludicrous California blue-sky babble about ‘hyperloops’ to the gritty topic of train travel in England. \n",
            "Sure enough, the audience hooted at me in derision (thankfully, it was the ‘warm-up’ round and was never broadcast).\n",
            "But look where we are today. The prototype hyperloop has been built and is working in Las Vegas. The technology is being developed by yet another Elon Musk start-up, The Boring Company, which aims to eliminate urban traffic by digging underground tunnels in big cities.\n",
            "Oh, and did I mention Neuralink? Musk founded that company to develop artificial intelligence and neural implants to help people with brain injuries, neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease and even paralysis to regain some independence by controlling computers and mobile devices with their brain.\n",
            "+4\n",

            "Ludicrously, some commentators have even argued that Musk’s intention to ensure free speech on Twitter is itself a threat to free speech. These insults could not be more wrong\n",
            "And speaking of the fight for independence, soon after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Elon Musk announced that high-speed broadband had been restored across the country thanks to Starlink satellites developed by SpaceX. \n",
            "Musk has donated thousands of terminals which are now operational in hospitals, energy installations and other critical infrastructure.\n",
            "The technology even beat the Russian army’s hacking attempt with a rapid software upgrade, impressing the head of the Pentagon’s electromagnetic warfare division, who said: ‘That is fantastic . . . how they did that is kind of eye-watering to me . . . we need to be able to have that ability.’\n",
            "This is the background to the business adventure that has put Elon Musk in the spotlight as never before, while bringing down on him the vicious ire of the Establishment, media and Left-leaning politicians: his attempt to buy the social media site Twitter and make it a forum for free speech.\n",
            "This week, he unveiled a $46.5 billion finance package for the bid — $21 billion in equity and $25.5 billion from Morgan Stanley — tweeting that if he succeeded in buying Twitter, the company would focus on removing spam from the site.\n",
            "The elite, clearly rattled by the prospect of a serious challenge to their control of the public conversation, have tried to characterise Elon Musk’s bid for Twitter as a menacing attempt by a crazed billionaire to seize control of the world’s digital public square, so he can impose his own ‘far-Right’ views. It is ‘troubling’, ‘dangerous’, ‘a threat to our democracy’, they desperately witter.\n",
            "Ludicrously, some commentators have even argued that Musk’s intention to ensure free speech on Twitter is itself a threat to free speech.\n",
            "These insults could not be more wrong. They completely misunderstand Elon Musk’s mindset, his motives and the real menace in this story: the Establishment’s relentless, demented — almost totalitarian — zeal to impose its own insular, woke groupthink on the world.\n",
            "Over the past few days, I have spoken to friends who know and have worked with Elon Musk about what really makes him tick. A clear and consistent picture emerges.\n",
            "He is above all an engineer — probably one of the best in the world. When an earlier model of his Tesla electric car was plagued by production problems, he spent night after night sleeping on the floor of the California factory to try to work out what was going wrong.\n",
            "He had already hired some of the best-qualified automotive engineers anywhere. Yet, in the end, it was Musk himself, screwdriver in hand, who solved the problems.\n",
            "Solving problems is what motivates him. When an interviewer once suggested to him that he had a tenuous grip on reality, he replied that ‘physics is the most real thing there is’. He sees problems in the world and tries to use physics and engineering to solve them.\n",
            "We have seen the rise in recent years of Silicon Valley billionaires who have amassed huge wealth and influence through producing innovative software — websites and apps such as Google and Facebook.\n",
            "What Elon Musk has done is different and, frankly, far more difficult. He has built businesses that focus on hardware — and hardware that is exceptionally hard to get right, such as reusable space rockets.\n",
            "And this is how Musk thinks about Twitter and its role in society: as an engineering problem.\n",
            "His Neuralink start-up approaches the human brain as a computer, albeit one far more sophisticated than anything technologists have built. If the brain is the ‘hardware’, Musk believes millions of people around the world have fallen prey to malicious ‘software’ that is affecting society in destructive and divisive ways.\n",
            "He has called it the ‘woke mind virus’ — the ideology that drives so much of today’s activism and cancel culture. His key observation is that this ‘software’ was written by someone else — by the far-Left academic ideologues pushing wokeism.\n",

            "He wants people to think for themselves, to see and hear all points of view, to come to their own conclusions. He believes that is the way to get the best outcomes for society: the scientific method.\n",
            "Elon Musk is not arguing for free speech because he wants to impose his views on everyone else. Instead, he wants all views to be available to everyone.\n",
            "Indeed, it is hard to even pin down where Musk stands politically. Some of his stances — for example on marijuana, and government regulations — might place him on the political, even libertarian Right. On the other hand, his strong environmentalism (before it was folded into Tesla, Musk was connected with yet another company, SolarCity, which produced and installed solar panels) used to be heralded by the Left.\n",
            "But that was before his stance on free speech made him the mortal enemy of the Leftist Establishment, threatening their ability to police what we can all say and thereby, they hope, what we think.\n",
            "Their power to do this has been building for years, enabled by the fact that the giant tech companies, now so central to our public and political discourse, are all based in the most Left-wing part of America: the San Francisco Bay area, where I live.\n",
            "Public data on the political donations of tech workers confirms what many long suspected: they are overwhelmingly Left-wing — and not just Left-wing but far-Left. This matters because of the way online speech is policed today.\n",
            "We hear a lot about the ‘algorithms’ used by Twitter, Google, YouTube, Facebook and others for ‘content moderation’. The companies claim these algorithms are impartial tools to prevent the spread of ‘misinformation’.\n",
            "But the content suppressed by the algorithms all seems to fall on one side of the political divide, leading many to suspect that ‘misinformation’ is simply the Establishment’s term for opinions that run counter to its approved narrative and groupthink.\n",
            "This suspicion is given further weight when we realise that algorithms are not some objective, technical device but computer code that is written by people — the same, generally far-Left, software engineers and product managers who work for the tech companies.\n",
            "The problem — and the truly ‘undemocratic’ nature of this ‘thought policing’ — is that the policies, values and assumptions expressed in these algorithms are hidden from public view. This is an outrageous breach of the trust we have the right to expect from companies that play such a crucial role in shaping our society. And this is the central focus of Elon Musk’s intentions for Twitter.\n",
            "In his view, the Twitter board of directors have abdicated their role as guardians of the public interest. They have barely any stake in the company and have allowed it to be taken over by activists pushing the ‘woke mind virus’.\n",

            "Musk believes that not only can he improve Twitter as a business by taking it private, but he can bring transparency and accountability to the hugely consequential decisions it makes about what can and can’t be said — with a strong bias in favour of permissiveness. Of course, critics may laugh at the suggestion that this often eccentric billionaire, literally the world’s richest man, can in any way represent ‘the public interest’.\n",
            "They would no doubt argue that such a brash individual, who smoked marijuana during a video interview in 2018 and recently endorsed the use of psychedelic drugs, would be a danger to the public if he managed to get his hands on Twitter.\n",
            "How could anyone take seriously a man who had a son with electronic pop star Grimes, then named him X Æ A-Xii; and who was reportedly the inspiration for the maverick genius Tony Stark, played by Robert Downey Jr in the Iron Man superhero films?\n",
            "But again, this is to misunderstand Musk’s worldview. He has recently argued that his business ventures are in fact philanthropy in the original Greek meaning of the word — ‘love of humanity’.\n",
            "Whether it is exploring space so humans can live on other planets and preserve Earth, pioneering electric cars for the mass market or ending traffic jams, Musk genuinely sees his role as solving mankind’s problems through business.\n",
            "That is not some outlandish concept — in fact, it is what I argued for in my book Good Business 20 years ago, and through my consulting firm of the same name.\n",
            "With Musk, the publicity hasn’t all been positive. There was a nasty libel case prompted by the totally uncalled-for ‘paedo guy’ insult hurled at a British caver during the rescue of trapped Thai schoolboys in 2018. There were ethical concerns raised about the way SolarCity was acquired by Tesla. And yes, Musk can be a bit of a troll on Twitter.\n",
            "But most of his trolling is directed at government and regulators. Isn’t a billionaire who challenges authority much more admirable than one who fawns and sucks up to it — as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos did with his purchase of the ultimate Establishment mouthpiece, the Washington Post?\n",
            "Bezos has now adopted the lifestyle of an uber-rich celebrity, swanning around the world posting photos of himself on superyachts.\n",
            "Elon Musk, by contrast, has said he has sold his homes and most of his possessions and now stays in friends’ spare bedrooms when he travels — which is only for work.\n",
            "It seems to me he has earned the right to be taken at face value when he says he is motivated not by money but by making the world a better place.\n",

            "Twitter Inc. TWTR 3.93% is re-examining Elon Musk’s $43 billion takeover offer after the billionaire lined up financing for the bid, in a sign the social-media company could be more receptive to a deal.\n",
            "Twitter had been expected to rebuff the offer, which Mr. Musk made earlier this month without saying how he would pay for it. But after he disclosed last week that he now has $46.5 billion in financing, Twitter is taking a fresh look at the offer and is more likely than before to seek to negotiate, people familiar with the matter said. The situation is fast-moving and it is still far from guaranteed Twitter will do so.\n",
            "Twitter is still working on an all-important estimate of its own value, which would need to come in close to Mr. Musk’s offer, and it could also insist on sweeteners such as Mr. Musk agreeing to cover breakup protections should the deal fall apart, some of the people said.\n",
            "The two sides are meeting Sunday to discuss Mr. Musk’s proposal, the people said.\n",

            "PAUL SAKUMA/ASSOCIATED PRESS\n",
            "Twitter is expected to weigh in on the bid when it reports first-quarter earnings Thursday, if not sooner, the people said. Twitter’s response won’t necessarily be black-and-white, and could leave the door open for inviting other bidders or negotiating with Mr. Musk on terms other than price. Mr. Musk reiterated to Twitter’s chairman Bret Taylor in recent days that he won’t budge from his offer of $54.20-a-share, the people said.\n",
            "The potential turnabout on Twitter’s part comes after Mr. Musk met privately Friday with several shareholders of the company to extol the virtues of his proposal while repeating that the board has a “yes-or-no” decision to make, according to people familiar with the matter. He also pledged to solve the free-speech issues he sees as plaguing the platform and the country more broadly, whether his bid succeeds or not, they said.\n",
            "The Tesla Inc. TSLA -0.37% chief executive made his pitch to select shareholders in a series of video calls, with a focus on actively managed funds, the people said, in hopes that they could sway the company’s decision.\n",
            "Mr. Musk said he sees no way Twitter management can get the stock to his offer price on its own, given the issues in the business and a persistent inability to correct them. It couldn’t be learned if he detailed specific steps he would take, though he has tweeted about wanting to reduce the platform’s reliance on advertising, as well as to make simpler changes such as allowing longer tweets.\n",
            "Mr. Musk already has some shareholders rallying behind him following the meetings. Lauri Brunner, who manages Thrivent Asset Management LLC’s large-cap growth fund, sees Mr. Musk as a skilled operator. “He has an established track record at Tesla,” she said. “He is the catalyst to deliver strong operating performance at Twitter.” Minneapolis-based Thrivent has a roughly 0.4% stake in Twitter worth $160 million and is also a Tesla shareholder.\n",
            "Mr. Musk already has said he is considering taking his bid directly to shareholders by launching a tender offer. Even if he was to get significant shareholder support in a tender offer—which is far from guaranteed—he would still need a way around the company’s poison pill, a legal maneuver it employed that effectively blocks him from building his stake to 15% or more.\n",

            "One oft-employed tactic to push a bid, seeking to gain control of the target’s board, is out of reach for now. Twitter’s directors have staggered terms, meaning a dissident shareholder would need multiple years to gain control rather than a single shareholder vote. Twitter tried last year to phase out the staggered board terms given that they are frowned upon by the corporate-governance community, but not enough shareholders voted on the measure. The company is attempting to do so again at this year’s annual meeting set for May 25. Only two directors are up for re-election, and it is too late for Mr. Musk to nominate his own.\n",
            "Twitter’s shares have been trading below his offer price since he made the bid April 14, typically a sign that shareholders are skeptical a deal will happen, though they did close up roughly 4% Friday at $48.93, the day after he unveiled financing for the deal. He has indicated that if the current bid fails, he could sell his stake, of more than 9%.\n",
            "The financing included more than $25 billion in debt coming from nearly every global blue-chip investment bank aside from the two advising Twitter. The remainder was $21 billion in equity Mr. Musk would provide himself, likely by selling existing stakes in his other businesses such as Tesla. The speed at which the financing came together and the market selloff in recent days—which makes the all-cash offer look relatively more attractive—likely contributed to Twitter’s greater willingness to entertain Mr. Musk’s proposal.\n",

            "Twitter’s board should engage with Mr. Musk since its stock has “gone nowhere” since the company went public eight years ago, said Jeff Gramm, a portfolio manager with Bandera Partners LLC, a New York hedge fund with about $385 million under management. The firm last bought Twitter shares in February and owns about 950,000 overall, which accounts for about 11% of its portfolio.\n",
            "Mr. Gramm said Twitter’s board can’t walk away from Mr. Musk’s offer without providing an alternative that gives real value to shareholders. “I’m not sure what that can be at this stage besides finding a higher bid,” he said.\n",

            "Twitter Inc. TWTR 3.93% is re-examining Elon Musk’s $43 billion takeover offer after the billionaire lined up financing for the bid, in a sign the social-media company could be more receptive to a deal.\n",
            "Twitter had been expected to rebuff the offer, which Mr. Musk made earlier this month without saying how he would pay for it. But after he disclosed last week that he now has $46.5 billion in financing, Twitter is taking a fresh look at the offer and is more likely than before to seek to negotiate, people familiar with the matter said. The situation is fast-moving and it is still far from guaranteed Twitter will do so.\n",
            "Twitter is still working on an all-important estimate of its own value, which would need to come in close to Mr. Musk’s offer, and it could also insist on sweeteners such as Mr. Musk agreeing to cover breakup protections should the deal fall apart, some of the people said.\n",
            "The two sides are meeting Sunday to discuss Mr. Musk’s proposal, the people said.\n",

            "Twitter is expected to weigh in on the bid when it reports first-quarter earnings Thursday, if not sooner, the people said. Twitter’s response won’t necessarily be black-and-white, and could leave the door open for inviting other bidders or negotiating with Mr. Musk on terms other than price. Mr. Musk reiterated to Twitter’s chairman Bret Taylor in recent days that he won’t budge from his offer of $54.20-a-share, the people said.\n",

            "The potential turnabout on Twitter’s part comes after Mr. Musk met privately Friday with several shareholders of the company to extol the virtues of his proposal while repeating that the board has a “yes-or-no” decision to make, according to people familiar with the matter. He also pledged to solve the free-speech issues he sees as plaguing the platform and the country more broadly, whether his bid succeeds or not, they said.\n",
            "The Tesla Inc. TSLA -0.37% chief executive made his pitch to select shareholders in a series of video calls, with a focus on actively managed funds, the people said, in hopes that they could sway the company’s decision.\n",
            "Mr. Musk said he sees no way Twitter management can get the stock to his offer price on its own, given the issues in the business and a persistent inability to correct them. It couldn’t be learned if he detailed specific steps he would take, though he has tweeted about wanting to reduce the platform’s reliance on advertising, as well as to make simpler changes such as allowing longer tweets.\n",
            "Mr. Musk already has some shareholders rallying behind him following the meetings. Lauri Brunner, who manages Thrivent Asset Management LLC’s large-cap growth fund, sees Mr. Musk as a skilled operator. “He has an established track record at Tesla,” she said. “He is the catalyst to deliver strong operating performance at Twitter.” Minneapolis-based Thrivent has a roughly 0.4% stake in Twitter worth $160 million and is also a Tesla shareholder.\n",

            "Twitter had been expected to rebuff the offer, which Mr. Musk made earlier this month without saying how he would pay for it. But after he disclosed last week that he now has $46.5 billion in financing, Twitter is taking a fresh look at the offer and is more likely than before to seek to negotiate, people familiar with the matter said. The situation is fast-moving and it is still far from guaranteed Twitter will do so.\n",
            "Twitter is still working on an all-important estimate of its own value, which would need to come in close to Mr. Musk’s offer, and it could also insist on sweeteners such as Mr. Musk agreeing to cover breakup protections should the deal fall apart, some of the people said.\n",

            "Twitter is expected to weigh in on the bid when it reports first-quarter earnings Thursday, if not sooner, the people said. Twitter’s response won’t necessarily be black-and-white, and could leave the door open for inviting other bidders or negotiating with Mr. Musk on terms other than price. Mr. Musk reiterated to Twitter’s chairman Bret Taylor in recent days that he won’t budge from his offer of $54.20-a-share, the people said.\n",

            "The potential turnabout on Twitter’s part comes after Mr. Musk met privately Friday with several shareholders of the company to extol the virtues of his proposal while repeating that the board has a “yes-or-no” decision to make, according to people familiar with the matter. He also pledged to solve the free-speech issues he sees as plaguing the platform and the country more broadly, whether his bid succeeds or not, they said.\n",
            "The Tesla Inc. TSLA -0.37% chief executive made his pitch to select shareholders in a series of video calls, with a focus on actively managed funds, the people said, in hopes that they could sway the company’s decision.\n",
            "Mr. Musk said he sees no way Twitter management can get the stock to his offer price on its own, given the issues in the business and a persistent inability to correct them. It couldn’t be learned if he detailed specific steps he would take, though he has tweeted about wanting to reduce the platform’s reliance on advertising, as well as to make simpler changes such as allowing longer tweets.\n",
            "Mr. Musk already has some shareholders rallying behind him following the meetings. Lauri Brunner, who manages Thrivent Asset Management LLC’s large-cap growth fund, sees Mr. Musk as a skilled operator. “He has an established track record at Tesla,” she said. “He is the catalyst to deliver strong operating performance at Twitter.” Minneapolis-based Thrivent has a roughly 0.4% stake in Twitter worth $160 million and is also a Tesla shareholder.\n",
            "Mr. Musk already has said he is considering taking his bid directly to shareholders by launching a tender offer. Even if he was to get significant shareholder support in a tender offer—which is far from guaranteed—he would still need a way around the company’s poison pill, a legal maneuver it employed that effectively blocks him from building his stake to 15% or more.\n",

            "When the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, announced his intention to buy Twitter, he declared with his usual visionary gusto, “I will unlock Twitter’s value.”\n",
            "It sent the stock price of Twitter soaring, but what unlocking value for Twitter actually means is hard to know for Musk, the self-proclaimed “free speech absolutist.”\n",
            "For one, it isn’t certain that Musk, who had earlier acquired a 9 per cent stake in Twitter amid rumblings of taking a seat on the Twitter’s board of directors, which was later dropped, can even afford to purchase Twitter.\n",

            "ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n",
            "SKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n",
            "Musk is already highly leveraged with almost half of his 17 per cent stake in Tesla, which has made him richest person in the world, being pledged in his other ventures. Musk himself stated he wasn’t certain if he can pull off this acquisition and might need even more loans to get this deal done.\n",
            "Moreover, Twitter itself has responded by adopting a “poison pill” to make such an acquisition by Musk even more difficult to succeed.\n",
            "If “free speech absolutism” means saying whatever you want without consequences, then we have a problem.\n",
            "For example, Tesla has garnered intensifying scrutiny by federal U.S. regulators aghast with the incidents of its cars getting into accidents while drivers blindly rely on autopilot systems being inaccurately advertised as “full self-driving.”\n",
            "SKIP ADVERTISEMENT\n",
            "ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n",
            "With U.S. net neutrality for internet platforms coming under fire with potential changes by the Federal Communications Commission, platforms need to self-regulate the internet as governments lack the technical means to do so.\n",
            "Twitter isn’t alone in its failings.\n",
            "Facebook, like Twitter, allowed Donald Trump and others to run amok to deny the science and validity of vaccines undermining health-care systems and then they had to institute fact checking and to label content spurious. Even then, their systems are not foolproof since disinformation still gets through.\n",
            "As we can see in the conflict in Ukraine, the global warfare and consequences of disinformation are real. Lies are cheap and easy on social media because disinformation isn’t about convincing everyone of one truth, but rather about forming wedges and micro-divisions in society to provoke fundamental social discord.\n",
            "Musk’s foray into Twitter should bring the necessary attention to social media and the impact of disinformation since its effectiveness depends on who is willing or vulnerable to believe what is being peddled.\n",
            "Musk can clean up Twitter as an example for other social media platforms to address the mistakes of the past, or will Musk let Twitter become the Rumble of free speech where anything goes for profit?\n",
            "If Musk chooses the former, society will benefit, people will take their vaccines, and we’ll believe in and fight climate change.\n",
            "If it’s the latter, we can expect the world and the flames of disinformation and social upheaval to burn hotter than a Tesla on fire.\n",
            "The latter seems more likely.\n",

            "Twitter had been expected to rebuff the offer, which Mr. Musk made earlier this month without saying how he would pay for it. But after he disclosed last week that he now has $46.5 billion in financing, Twitter is taking a fresh look at the offer and is more likely than before to seek to negotiate, people familiar with the matter said. The situation is fast-moving and it is still far from guaranteed Twitter will do so.\n",
            "Twitter is still working on an all-important estimate of its own value, which would need to come in close to Mr. Musk’s offer, and it could also insist on sweeteners such as Mr. Musk agreeing to cover breakup protections should the deal fall apart, some of the people said.\n",

            "The potential turnabout on Twitter’s part comes after Mr. Musk met privately Friday with several shareholders of the company to extol the virtues of his proposal while repeating that the board has a “yes-or-no” decision to make, according to people familiar with the matter. He also pledged to solve the free-speech issues he sees as plaguing the platform and the country more broadly, whether his bid succeeds or not, they said.\n",
            "The Tesla Inc. TSLA -0.37% chief executive made his pitch to select shareholders in a series of video calls, with a focus on actively managed funds, the people said, in hopes that they could sway the company’s decision.\n",
            "Mr. Musk said he sees no way Twitter management can get the stock to his offer price on its own, given the issues in the business and a persistent inability to correct them. It couldn’t be learned if he detailed specific steps he would take, though he has tweeted about wanting to reduce the platform’s reliance on advertising, as well as to make simpler changes such as allowing longer tweets.\n",
            "Mr. Musk already has some shareholders rallying behind him following the meetings. Lauri Brunner, who manages Thrivent Asset Management LLC’s large-cap growth fund, sees Mr. Musk as a skilled operator. “He has an established track record at Tesla,” she said. “He is the catalyst to deliver strong operating performance at Twitter.” Minneapolis-based Thrivent has a roughly 0.4% stake in Twitter worth $160 million and is also a Tesla shareholder.\n",
            "Mr. Musk already has said he is considering taking his bid directly to shareholders by launching a tender offer. Even if he was to get significant shareholder support in a tender offer—which is far from guaranteed—he would still need a way around the company’s poison pill, a legal maneuver it employed that effectively blocks him from building his stake to 15% or more.\n",

            "One oft-employed tactic to push a bid, seeking to gain control of the target’s board, is out of reach for now. Twitter’s directors have staggered terms, meaning a dissident shareholder would need multiple years to gain control rather than a single shareholder vote. Twitter tried last year to phase out the staggered board terms given that they are frowned upon by the corporate-governance community, but not enough shareholders voted on the measure. The company is attempting to do so again at this year’s annual meeting set for May 25. Only two directors are up for re-election, and it is too late for Mr. Musk to nominate his own.\n",
            "Twitter’s shares have been trading below his offer price since he made the bid April 14, typically a sign that shareholders are skeptical a deal will happen, though they did close up roughly 4% Friday at $48.93, the day after he unveiled financing for the deal. He has indicated that if the current bid fails, he could sell his stake, of more than 9%.\n",
            "The financing included more than $25 billion in debt coming from nearly every global blue-chip investment bank aside from the two advising Twitter. The remainder was $21 billion in equity Mr. Musk would provide himself, likely by selling existing stakes in his other businesses such as Tesla. The speed at which the financing came together and the market selloff in recent days—which makes the all-cash offer look relatively more attractive—likely contributed to Twitter’s greater willingness to entertain Mr. Musk’s proposal.\n",

            "Twitter’s board should engage with Mr. Musk since its stock has “gone nowhere” since the company went public eight years ago, said Jeff Gramm, a portfolio manager with Bandera Partners LLC, a New York hedge fund with about $385 million under management. The firm last bought Twitter shares in February and owns about 950,000 overall, which accounts for about 11% of its portfolio.\n",
            "Mr. Gramm said Twitter’s board can’t walk away from Mr. Musk’s offer without providing an alternative that gives real value to shareholders. “I’m not sure what that can be at this stage besides finding a higher bid,” he said.\n",

            "Twitter Inc. TWTR 3.93% is re-examining Elon Musk’s $43 billion takeover offer after the billionaire lined up financing for the bid, in a sign the social-media company could be more receptive to a deal.\n",
            "Twitter had been expected to rebuff the offer, which Mr. Musk made earlier this month without saying how he would pay for it. But after he disclosed last week that he now has $46.5 billion in financing, Twitter is taking a fresh look at the offer and is more likely than before to seek to negotiate, people familiar with the matter said. The situation is fast-moving and it is still far from guaranteed Twitter will do so.\n",
            "Twitter is still working on an all-important estimate of its own value, which would need to come in close to Mr. Musk’s offer, and it could also insist on sweeteners such as Mr. Musk agreeing to cover breakup protections should the deal fall apart, some of the people said.\n",

            "Twitter is expected to weigh in on the bid when it reports first-quarter earnings Thursday, if not sooner, the people said. Twitter’s response won’t necessarily be black-and-white, and could leave the door open for inviting other bidders or negotiating with Mr. Musk on terms other than price. Mr. Musk reiterated to Twitter’s chairman Bret Taylor in recent days that he won’t budge from his offer of $54.20-a-share, the people said.\n",

            "The potential turnabout on Twitter’s part comes after Mr. Musk met privately Friday with several shareholders of the company to extol the virtues of his proposal while repeating that the board has a “yes-or-no” decision to make, according to people familiar with the matter. He also pledged to solve the free-speech issues he sees as plaguing the platform and the country more broadly, whether his bid succeeds or not, they said.\n",
            "The Tesla Inc. TSLA -0.37% chief executive made his pitch to select shareholders in a series of video calls, with a focus on actively managed funds, the people said, in hopes that they could sway the company’s decision.\n",
            "Mr. Musk said he sees no way Twitter management can get the stock to his offer price on its own, given the issues in the business and a persistent inability to correct them. It couldn’t be learned if he detailed specific steps he would take, though he has tweeted about wanting to reduce the platform’s reliance on advertising, as well as to make simpler changes such as allowing longer tweets.\n",
            "Mr. Musk already has some shareholders rallying behind him following the meetings. Lauri Brunner, who manages Thrivent Asset Management LLC’s large-cap growth fund, sees Mr. Musk as a skilled operator. “He has an established track record at Tesla,” she said. “He is the catalyst to deliver strong operating performance at Twitter.” Minneapolis-based Thrivent has a roughly 0.4% stake in Twitter worth $160 million and is also a Tesla shareholder.\n",
            "Mr. Musk already has said he is considering taking his bid directly to shareholders by launching a tender offer. Even if he was to get significant shareholder support in a tender offer—which is far from guaranteed—he would still need a way around the company’s poison pill, a legal maneuver it employed that effectively blocks him from building his stake to 15% or more.\n",

            "One oft-employed tactic to push a bid, seeking to gain control of the target’s board, is out of reach for now. Twitter’s directors have staggered terms, meaning a dissident shareholder would need multiple years to gain control rather than a single shareholder vote. Twitter tried last year to phase out the staggered board terms given that they are frowned upon by the corporate-governance community, but not enough shareholders voted on the measure. The company is attempting to do so again at this year’s annual meeting set for May 25. Only two directors are up for re-election, and it is too late for Mr. Musk to nominate his own.\n",

            "lon Musk has now put together a $46.5bn financing package to buy Twitter – two thirds of it from his own assets, and a third from bank loans secured against Twitter’s assets. It’s the biggest acquisition financing ever put forward for one person.\n",

            "Twitter’s founder and top managers don’t want Musk to take over the company. They offered him a seat on the board but he didn’t want it because he’d have to be responsible to all other shareholders. Now they’re adopting a “poison pill” to stop him. But Musk plans to buy shares directly with a tender offer that shareholders can’t refuse. After all, it’s a free market.\n",
            "Musk says no one should object to what he wants to do with Twitter because he’s a “free speech absolutist,” and who can be against free speech? Besides, he and his apologists say, if consumers don’t like what he does with Twitter they can go elsewhere. Freedom to choose.\n",
            "Free market? Free speech? Free choice?\n",
            "When billionaires like Musk justify their motives by using “freedom,” beware. What they actually seek is freedom from accountability. They want to use their vast fortunes to do whatever they please – unconstrained by laws or regulations, shareholders, or even consumers.\n",
            "The “free market” increasingly reflects the demands of big money. Unfriendly takeovers, such as Musk is mounting at Twitter, weren’t part of the “free market” until the late 1970s and early 1980s. Before then, laws and regulations constrained them. Then came corporate raiders like Carl Icahn and Michael Milken. Their MO was to find corporations whose assets were worth more than their stock value, borrow against them, acquire enough shares to force them to cut costs (such as laying off workers, abandoning their communities, busting unions, and taking on crushing debt), and cash in.\n",
            "But the raiders’ antics often imposed huge social costs. They pushed America from stakeholder capitalism (where workers and communities had a say in what corporations did) to shareholder capitalism (where the sole corporate goal is to maximize shareholder value). Inequality skyrocketed, insecurity soared, vast swaths of America were abandoned, and millions of good jobs vanished.\n",
            "The raiders altered the “free market” to allow them to do this. That’s what the super-rich do. There’s no “free market” in nature. The “free market” depends on laws and rules. If you have enough money, you can buy changes in those laws and rules that make you even more money. (You can also get the government to subsidize you – Musk has received a reported $4.9bn so far.)\n",
            "“Free speech” is another freedom that turns on wealth. As a practical matter, your ability to be heard turns on the size of the megaphone you can buy. If you’re extremely rich you can purchase the Washington Post or own Fox News. If you’re the wealthiest person in the world you can buy one of the biggest megaphones in the world called Twitter – and then decide who can use it, what its algorithms are going to be, and how it either invites or filters out big lies.\n",
            "Musk said last week that he doesn’t care about the economics of the deal and is pursuing it because it is “extremely important to the future of civilization.” Fine, but who anointed Musk to decide the future of civilization?\n",
            "Which brings us to free choice. If consumers don’t like what Musk does with Twitter, they cannot simply switch to another Twitter-like platform. There aren’t any. The largest social media platforms have grown gigantic because anyone who wants to participate in them and influence debate has to join them. After they reach a certain size, they’re the only megaphone in town. Where else would consumers go to post short messages that can reach tens of millions of people other than Twitter?\n",
            "With social media, the ordinary rules of competition don’t apply. Once a platform is dominant it becomes even more dominant. As Donald Trump discovered with his “Truth Social” fiasco, upstarts don’t stand much chance.\n",
            "Musk’s real goal has nothing to do with the freedom of others. His goal is his own unconstrained freedom – the freedom to wield enormous power without having to be accountable to laws and regulations, to shareholders, or to market competition – which is why he’s dead set on owning Twitter.\n",
            "Unlike his ambitions to upend transportation and interstellar flight, this one is dangerous. It might well upend democracy.\n",

            "The richest man in the world, Elon Musk, recently purchased a 9% stake in Twitter, the social media platform that permanently banned former President Donald Trump and that conservatives accuse of suppressing their content.\n",
            "Musk's purchase made him Twitter's largest shareholder, and he vowed to take it over, possibly to turn it into a private company. Its CEO vowed to fight the effort, and one of its largest shareholders, a Saudi Arabian prince who owns 95% of Saudi's Kingdom Holding Company, issued a statement rejecting Musk's offer as inadequate.\n",
            "Conservative pundit Derek Hunter said: “Media outlets are applauding Saudi Arabia's government, a stakeholder in Twitter, for objecting to Elon Musk's offer. After years of attacking Saudi Arabia for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi ... and a history of homophobia (try being gay there), they're now heroes to the left.”\n",
            "Much of the left-wing media salutes the effort to stave off Musk. Consider this Orwellian exchange between MSNBC host Rev. Al “no justice, no peace” Sharpton and Democratic strategist Danielle Moodie:\n",
            "Sharpton: “Are you concerned that what Musk is trying to do is to open up the platform for more misinformation about topics such as COVID-19 and the 2020 election? And perhaps even allow former President Trump to get his account back?”\n",
            "Moodie: “I'm going to be honest, Elon Musk is a danger to Twitter and to freedom of speech.”\n",
            "And, Democrats being Democrats, out came the race card. Former Bill Clinton secretary of labor and professor at U. C. Berkeley Robert Reich tweeted: “So let me get this straight: Elon Musk claims to want to save humanity by creating a space colony, but doesn't want workers to join a union and has reportedly created a racist workplace?”\n",
            "Before Parag Agrawal became the CEO of Twitter, the then-company senior executive said that Twitter's “role is not to be bound by the First Amendment” and that he wanted its content to be “reflective of things that we believe lead to a healthier public conversation.” He added that Twitter would “focus less on thinking about free speech” because “speech is easy on the internet. Most people can speak. Where our role is particularly emphasized is who can be heard.”\n",
            "In other words, it's not only what one says, but who is saying it.\n",
            "So, the anti-white, antisemitic Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam, who in 2018 said “(Jews are) the mother and father of apartheid,” has a Twitter account.\n",
            "MSNBC's Joy Reid, in her blog, wrote “(anti-gay attitudes are due to) concerns that adult gay men tend to be attracted to very young, post-pubescent types, bringing them 'into the lifestyle' in a way that many people consider to be immoral.” She also questioned who attacked America on 9/11: “The fundamental question is: do you believe the official story of 9/11? ... If you don't, then everything ... is called into serious question. Even if you're agnostic, or you tend to believe that al-Qaida attacked the World Trade Center and Pentagon ... it's worth taking a second look.” Reid has a Twitter account.\n",
            "The president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, was recently called a “war criminal” by President Joe Biden. Sayyid Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, claimed that the coronavirus vaccines were “untrustworthy” and accused the Western countries of attempting to “contaminate” other countries with a vaccine. Both have Twitter accounts.\n",
            "About the Twitter board of directors, even former president and founder Jack Dorsey heaped criticism by tweeting the board has “consistently been the dysfunction of the company.”\n",
            "As a publicly traded company, Twitter has a fiduciary obligation to maximize shareholder investment. Yet, by suppressing conservatives Twitter gives the finger to much of the country, a policy inconsistent with the company's own financial interest. Michael Jordan, asked to endorse a Democrat candidate running for office in his home state of North Carolina, refused, saying, “Republicans buy sneakers, too.”\n",
            "So, good luck, Mr. Musk. Perhaps next you'll buy The New York Times -- and turn it into a newspaper.\n",

            "Twitter Inc. TWTR 3.93% is re-examining Elon Musk’s $43 billion takeover offer after the billionaire lined up financing for the bid, in a sign the social-media company could be more receptive to a deal.\n",
            "Twitter had been expected to rebuff the offer, which Mr. Musk made earlier this month without saying how he would pay for it. But after he disclosed last week that he now has $46.5 billion in financing, Twitter is taking a fresh look at the offer and is more likely than before to seek to negotiate, people familiar with the matter said. The situation is fast-moving and it is still far from guaranteed Twitter will do so.\n",
            "Twitter is still working on an all-important estimate of its own value, which would need to come in close to Mr. Musk’s offer, and it could also insist on sweeteners such as Mr. Musk agreeing to cover breakup protections should the deal fall apart, some of the people said.\n",

            "PAUL SAKUMA/ASSOCIATED PRESS\n",
            "Twitter is expected to weigh in on the bid when it reports first-quarter earnings Thursday, if not sooner, the people said. Twitter’s response won’t necessarily be black-and-white, and could leave the door open for inviting other bidders or negotiating with Mr. Musk on terms other than price. Mr. Musk reiterated to Twitter’s chairman Bret Taylor in recent days that he won’t budge from his offer of $54.20-a-share, the people said.\n",
            "The potential turnabout on Twitter’s part comes after Mr. Musk met privately Friday with several shareholders of the company to extol the virtues of his proposal while repeating that the board has a “yes-or-no” decision to make, according to people familiar with the matter. He also pledged to solve the free-speech issues he sees as plaguing the platform and the country more broadly, whether his bid succeeds or not, they said.\n",
            "The Tesla Inc. TSLA -0.37% chief executive made his pitch to select shareholders in a series of video calls, with a focus on actively managed funds, the people said, in hopes that they could sway the company’s decision.\n",
            "Mr. Musk said he sees no way Twitter management can get the stock to his offer price on its own, given the issues in the business and a persistent inability to correct them. It couldn’t be learned if he detailed specific steps he would take, though he has tweeted about wanting to reduce the platform’s reliance on advertising, as well as to make simpler changes such as allowing longer tweets.\n",
            "Mr. Musk already has some shareholders rallying behind him following the meetings. Lauri Brunner, who manages Thrivent Asset Management LLC’s large-cap growth fund, sees Mr. Musk as a skilled operator. “He has an established track record at Tesla,” she said. “He is the catalyst to deliver strong operating performance at Twitter.” Minneapolis-based Thrivent has a roughly 0.4% stake in Twitter worth $160 million and is also a Tesla shareholder.\n",
            "Mr. Musk already has said he is considering taking his bid directly to shareholders by launching a tender offer. Even if he was to get significant shareholder support in a tender offer—which is far from guaranteed—he would still need a way around the company’s poison pill, a legal maneuver it employed that effectively blocks him from building his stake to 15% or more.\n",

            "PHOTO: MIGUEL ROBERTS/THE BROWNSVILLE HERALD/ASSOCIATED PRESS\n",
            "One oft-employed tactic to push a bid, seeking to gain control of the target’s board, is out of reach for now. Twitter’s directors have staggered terms, meaning a dissident shareholder would need multiple years to gain control rather than a single shareholder vote. Twitter tried last year to phase out the staggered board terms given that they are frowned upon by the corporate-governance community, but not enough shareholders voted on the measure. The company is attempting to do so again at this year’s annual meeting set for May 25. Only two directors are up for re-election, and it is too late for Mr. Musk to nominate his own.\n",
            "Twitter’s shares have been trading below his offer price since he made the bid April 14, typically a sign that shareholders are skeptical a deal will happen, though they did close up roughly 4% Friday at $48.93, the day after he unveiled financing for the deal. He has indicated that if the current bid fails, he could sell his stake, of more than 9%.\n",
            "The financing included more than $25 billion in debt coming from nearly every global blue-chip investment bank aside from the two advising Twitter. The remainder was $21 billion in equity Mr. Musk would provide himself, likely by selling existing stakes in his other businesses such as Tesla. The speed at which the financing came together and the market selloff in recent days—which makes the all-cash offer look relatively more attractive—likely contributed to Twitter’s greater willingness to entertain Mr. Musk’s proposal.\n",

            "Twitter’s board should engage with Mr. Musk since its stock has “gone nowhere” since the company went public eight years ago, said Jeff Gramm, a portfolio manager with Bandera Partners LLC, a New York hedge fund with about $385 million under management. The firm last bought Twitter shares in February and owns about 950,000 overall, which accounts for about 11% of its portfolio.\n",
            "Mr. Gramm said Twitter’s board can’t walk away from Mr. Musk’s offer without providing an alternative that gives real value to shareholders. “I’m not sure what that can be at this stage besides finding a higher bid,” he said.\n",

            "Twitter had been expected to rebuff the offer, which Mr. Musk made earlier this month without saying how he would pay for it. But after he disclosed last week that he now has $46.5 billion in financing, Twitter is taking a fresh look at the offer and is more likely than before to seek to negotiate, people familiar with the matter said. The situation is fast-moving and it is still far from guaranteed Twitter will do so.\n",
            "Twitter is still working on an all-important estimate of its own value, which would need to come in close to Mr. Musk’s offer, and it could also insist on sweeteners such as Mr. Musk agreeing to cover breakup protections should the deal fall apart, some of the people said.\n",

He also pledged to solve the free-speech issues he sees as plaguing the platform and the country more broadly, whether his bid succeeds or not, they said.\n",

            "Mr. Musk said he sees no way Twitter management can get the stock to his offer price on its own, given the issues in the business and a persistent inability to correct them. It couldn’t be learned if he detailed specific steps he would take, though he has tweeted about wanting to reduce the platform’s reliance on advertising, as well as to make simpler changes such as allowing longer tweets.\n",
            "Mr. Musk already has some shareholders rallying behind him following the meetings. Lauri Brunner, who manages Thrivent Asset Management LLC’s large-cap growth fund, sees Mr. Musk as a skilled operator. “He has an established track record at Tesla,” she said. “He is the catalyst to deliver strong operating performance at Twitter.” Minneapolis-based Thrivent has a roughly 0.4% stake in Twitter worth $160 million and is also a Tesla shareholder.\n",
            "Mr. Musk already has said he is considering taking his bid directly to shareholders by launching a tender offer. Even if he was to get significant shareholder support in a tender offer—which is far from guaranteed—he would still need a way around the company’s poison pill, a legal maneuver it employed that effectively blocks him from building his stake to 15% or more.\n",

            "One oft-employed tactic to push a bid, seeking to gain control of the target’s board, is out of reach for now. Twitter’s directors have staggered terms, meaning a dissident shareholder would need multiple years to gain control rather than a single shareholder vote. Twitter tried last year to phase out the staggered board terms given that they are frowned upon by the corporate-governance community, but not enough shareholders voted on the measure. The company is attempting to do so again at this year’s annual meeting set for May 25. Only two directors are up for re-election, and it is too late for Mr. Musk to nominate his own.\n",
            "Twitter’s shares have been trading below his offer price since he made the bid April 14, typically a sign that shareholders are skeptical a deal will happen, though they did close up roughly 4% Friday at $48.93, the day after he unveiled financing for the deal. He has indicated that if the current bid fails, he could sell his stake, of more than 9%.\n",
            "The financing included more than $25 billion in debt coming from nearly every global blue-chip investment bank aside from the two advising Twitter. The remainder was $21 billion in equity Mr. Musk would provide himself, likely by selling existing stakes in his other businesses such as Tesla. The speed at which the financing came together and the market selloff in recent days—which makes the all-cash offer look relatively more attractive—likely contributed to Twitter’s greater willingness to entertain Mr. Musk’s proposal.\n",

            "Twitter Inc. TWTR 3.93% is re-examining Elon Musk’s $43 billion takeover offer after the billionaire lined up financing for the bid, in a sign the social-media company could be more receptive to a deal.\n",
            "Twitter had been expected to rebuff the offer, which Mr. Musk made earlier this month without saying how he would pay for it. But after he disclosed last week that he now has $46.5 billion in financing, Twitter is taking a fresh look at the offer and is more likely than before to seek to negotiate, people familiar with the matter said. The situation is fast-moving and it is still far from guaranteed Twitter will do so.\n",
            "Twitter is still working on an all-important estimate of its own value, which would need to come in close to Mr. Musk’s offer, and it could also insist on sweeteners such as Mr. Musk agreeing to cover breakup protections should the deal fall apart, some of the people said.\n",

            "Twitter is expected to weigh in on the bid when it reports first-quarter earnings Thursday, if not sooner, the people said. Twitter’s response won’t necessarily be black-and-white, and could leave the door open for inviting other bidders or negotiating with Mr. Musk on terms other than price. Mr. Musk reiterated to Twitter’s chairman Bret Taylor in recent days that he won’t budge from his offer of $54.20-a-share, the people said.\n",

            "The potential turnabout on Twitter’s part comes after Mr. Musk met privately Friday with several shareholders of the company to extol the virtues of his proposal while repeating that the board has a “yes-or-no” decision to make, according to people familiar with the matter. He also pledged to solve the free-speech issues he sees as plaguing the platform and the country more broadly, whether his bid succeeds or not, they said.\n",
            "The Tesla Inc. TSLA -0.37% chief executive made his pitch to select shareholders in a series of video calls, with a focus on actively managed funds, the people said, in hopes that they could sway the company’s decision.\n",
            "Mr. Musk said he sees no way Twitter management can get the stock to his offer price on its own, given the issues in the business and a persistent inability to correct them. It couldn’t be learned if he detailed specific steps he would take, though he has tweeted about wanting to reduce the platform’s reliance on advertising, as well as to make simpler changes such as allowing longer tweets.\n",
            "Mr. Musk already has some shareholders rallying behind him following the meetings. Lauri Brunner, who manages Thrivent Asset Management LLC’s large-cap growth fund, sees Mr. Musk as a skilled operator. “He has an established track record at Tesla,” she said. “He is the catalyst to deliver strong operating performance at Twitter.” Minneapolis-based Thrivent has a roughly 0.4% stake in Twitter worth $160 million and is also a Tesla shareholder.\n",
            "Mr. Musk already has said he is considering taking his bid directly to shareholders by launching a tender offer. Even if he was to get significant shareholder support in a tender offer—which is far from guaranteed—he would still need a way around the company’s poison pill, a legal maneuver it employed that effectively blocks him from building his stake to 15% or more.\n",

            "One oft-employed tactic to push a bid, seeking to gain control of the target’s board, is out of reach for now. Twitter’s directors have staggered terms, meaning a dissident shareholder would need multiple years to gain control rather than a single shareholder vote. Twitter tried last year to phase out the staggered board terms given that they are frowned upon by the corporate-governance community, but not enough shareholders voted on the measure. The company is attempting to do so again at this year’s annual meeting set for May 25. Only two directors are up for re-election, and it is too late for Mr. Musk to nominate his own.\n",
            "Twitter’s shares have been trading below his offer price since he made the bid April 14, typically a sign that shareholders are skeptical a deal will happen, though they did close up roughly 4% Friday at $48.93, the day after he unveiled financing for the deal. He has indicated that if the current bid fails, he could sell his stake, of more than 9%.\n",
            "The financing included more than $25 billion in debt coming from nearly every global blue-chip investment bank aside from the two advising Twitter. The remainder was $21 billion in equity Mr. Musk would provide himself, likely by selling existing stakes in his other businesses such as Tesla. The speed at which the financing came together and the market selloff in recent days—which makes the all-cash offer look relatively more attractive—likely contributed to Twitter’s greater willingness to entertain Mr. Musk’s proposal.\n",

            "Twitter’s board should engage with Mr. Musk since its stock has “gone nowhere” since the company went public eight years ago, said Jeff Gramm, a portfolio manager with Bandera Partners LLC, a New York hedge fund with about $385 million under management. The firm last bought Twitter shares in February and owns about 950,000 overall, which accounts for about 11% of its portfolio.\n",
            "Mr. Gramm said Twitter’s board can’t walk away from Mr. Musk’s offer without providing an alternative that gives real value to shareholders. “I’m not sure what that can be at this stage besides finding a higher bid,” he said.\n",

            "Twitter had been expected to rebuff the offer, which Mr. Musk made earlier this month without saying how he would pay for it. But after he disclosed last week that he now has $46.5 billion in financing, Twitter is taking a fresh look at the offer and is more likely than before to seek to negotiate, people familiar with the matter said.

Twitter tried last year to phase out the staggered board terms given that they are frowned upon by the corporate-governance community, but not enough shareholders voted on the measure. The company is attempting to do so again at this year’s annual meeting set for May 25. Only two directors are up for re-election, and it is too late for Mr. Musk to nominate his own.\n",

He has indicated that if the current bid fails, he could sell his stake, of more than 9%.\n",
            "The financing included more than $25 billion in debt coming from nearly every global blue-chip investment bank aside from the two advising Twitter. The remainder was $21 billion in equity Mr. Musk would provide himself, likely by selling existing stakes in his other businesses such as Tesla.

            "Twitter Inc. TWTR 3.93% is re-examining Elon Musk’s $43 billion takeover offer after the billionaire lined up financing for the bid, in a sign the social-media company could be more receptive to a deal.\n",
            "Twitter had been expected to rebuff the offer, which Mr. Musk made earlier this month without saying how he would pay for it. But after he disclosed last week that he now has $46.5 billion in financing, Twitter is taking a fresh look at the offer and is more likely than before to seek to negotiate, people familiar with the matter said. The situation is fast-moving and it is still far from guaranteed Twitter will do so.\n",
            "Twitter is still working on an all-important estimate of its own value, which would need to come in close to Mr. Musk’s offer, and it could also insist on sweeteners such as Mr. Musk agreeing to cover breakup protections should the deal fall apart, some of the people said.\n",

Twitter’s response won’t necessarily be black-and-white, and could leave the door open for inviting other bidders or negotiating with Mr. Musk on terms other than price. Mr. Musk reiterated to Twitter’s chairman Bret Taylor in recent days that he won’t budge from his offer of $54.20-a-share, the people said.\n",

            "The potential turnabout on Twitter’s part comes after Mr. Musk met privately Friday with several shareholders of the company to extol the virtues of his proposal while repeating that the board has a “yes-or-no” decision to make, according to people familiar with the matter. He also pledged to solve the free-speech issues he sees as plaguing the platform and the country more broadly, whether his bid succeeds or not, they said.\n",
            "The Tesla Inc. TSLA -0.37% chief executive made his pitch to select shareholders in a series of video calls, with a focus on actively managed funds, the people said, in hopes that they could sway the company’s decision.\n",
            "Mr. Musk said he sees no way Twitter management can get the stock to his offer price on its own, given the issues in the business and a persistent inability to correct them. It couldn’t be learned if he detailed specific steps he would take, though he has tweeted about wanting to reduce the platform’s reliance on advertising, as well as to make simpler changes such as allowing longer tweets.\n",
            "Mr. Musk already has some shareholders rallying behind him following the meetings. Lauri Brunner, who manages Thrivent Asset Management LLC’s large-cap growth fund, sees Mr. Musk as a skilled operator. “He has an established track record at Tesla,” she said. “He is the catalyst to deliver strong operating performance at Twitter.” Minneapolis-based Thrivent has a roughly 0.4% stake in Twitter worth $160 million and is also a Tesla shareholder.\n",
            "Mr. Musk already has said he is considering taking his bid directly to shareholders by launching a tender offer. Even if he was to get significant shareholder support in a tender offer—which is far from guaranteed—he would still need a way around the company’s poison pill, a legal maneuver it employed that effectively blocks him from building his stake to 15% or more.\n",

            "One oft-employed tactic to push a bid, seeking to gain control of the target’s board, is out of reach for now. Twitter’s directors have staggered terms, meaning a dissident shareholder would need multiple years to gain control rather than a single shareholder vote. Twitter tried last year to phase out the staggered board terms given that they are frowned upon by the corporate-governance community, but not enough shareholders voted on the measure. The company is attempting to do so again at this year’s annual meeting set for May 25. Only two directors are up for re-election, and it is too late for Mr. Musk to nominate his own.\n",
            "Twitter’s shares have been trading below his offer price since he made the bid April 14, typically a sign that shareholders are skeptical a deal will happen, though they did close up roughly 4% Friday at $48.93, the day after he unveiled financing for the deal. He has indicated that if the current bid fails, he could sell his stake, of more than 9%.\n",
            "The financing included more than $25 billion in debt coming from nearly every global blue-chip investment bank aside from the two advising Twitter. The remainder was $21 billion in equity Mr. Musk would provide himself, likely by selling existing stakes in his other businesses such as Tesla. The speed at which the financing came together and the market selloff in recent days—which makes the all-cash offer look relatively more attractive—likely contributed to Twitter’s greater willingness to entertain Mr. Musk’s proposal.\n",

            "Twitter had been expected to rebuff the offer, which Mr. Musk made earlier this month without saying how he would pay for it. But after he disclosed last week that he now has $46.5 billion in financing, Twitter is taking a fresh look at the offer and is more likely than before to seek to negotiate, people familiar with the matter said. The situation is fast-moving and it is still far from guaranteed Twitter will do so.\n",
            "Twitter is still working on an all-important estimate of its own value, which would need to come in close to Mr. Musk’s offer, and it could also insist on sweeteners such as Mr. Musk agreeing to cover breakup protections should the deal fall apart, some of the people said.\n",

            "Twitter is expected to weigh in on the bid when it reports first-quarter earnings Thursday, if not sooner, the people said. Twitter’s response won’t necessarily be black-and-white, and could leave the door open for inviting other bidders or negotiating with Mr. Musk on terms other than price. Mr. Musk reiterated to Twitter’s chairman Bret Taylor in recent days that he won’t budge from his offer of $54.20-a-share, the people said.\n",

            "The potential turnabout on Twitter’s part comes after Mr. Musk met privately Friday with several shareholders of the company to extol the virtues of his proposal while repeating that the board has a “yes-or-no” decision to make, according to people familiar with the matter. He also pledged to solve the free-speech issues he sees as plaguing the platform and the country more broadly, whether his bid succeeds or not, they said.\n",
            "The Tesla Inc. TSLA -0.37% chief executive made his pitch to select shareholders in a series of video calls, with a focus on actively managed funds, the people said, in hopes that they could sway the company’s decision.\n",
            "Mr. Musk said he sees no way Twitter management can get the stock to his offer price on its own, given the issues in the business and a persistent inability to correct them. It couldn’t be learned if he detailed specific steps he would take, though he has tweeted about wanting to reduce the platform’s reliance on advertising, as well as to make simpler changes such as allowing longer tweets.\n",
            "Mr. Musk already has some shareholders rallying behind him following the meetings. Lauri Brunner, who manages Thrivent Asset Management LLC’s large-cap growth fund, sees Mr. Musk as a skilled operator. “He has an established track record at Tesla,” she said. “He is the catalyst to deliver strong operating performance at Twitter.” Minneapolis-based Thrivent has a roughly 0.4% stake in Twitter worth $160 million and is also a Tesla shareholder.\n",
            "Mr. Musk already has said he is considering taking his bid directly to shareholders by launching a tender offer. Even if he was to get significant shareholder support in a tender offer—which is far from guaranteed—he would still need a way around the company’s poison pill, a legal maneuver it employed that effectively blocks him from building his stake to 15% or more.\n",

            "PHOTO: MIGUEL ROBERTS/THE BROWNSVILLE HERALD/ASSOCIATED PRESS\n",
            "One oft-employed tactic to push a bid, seeking to gain control of the target’s board, is out of reach for now. Twitter’s directors have staggered terms, meaning a dissident shareholder would need multiple years to gain control rather than a single shareholder vote. Twitter tried last year to phase out the staggered board terms given that they are frowned upon by the corporate-governance community, but not enough shareholders voted on the measure. The company is attempting to do so again at this year’s annual meeting set for May 25. Only two directors are up for re-election, and it is too late for Mr. Musk to nominate his own.\n",
            "Twitter’s shares have been trading below his offer price since he made the bid April 14, typically a sign that shareholders are skeptical a deal will happen, though they did close up roughly 4% Friday at $48.93, the day after he unveiled financing for the deal. He has indicated that if the current bid fails, he could sell his stake, of more than 9%.\n",
            "The financing included more than $25 billion in debt coming from nearly every global blue-chip investment bank aside from the two advising Twitter. The remainder was $21 billion in equity Mr. Musk would provide himself, likely by selling existing stakes in his other businesses such as Tesla. The speed at which the financing came together and the market selloff in recent days—which makes the all-cash offer look relatively more attractive—likely contributed to Twitter’s greater willingness to entertain Mr. Musk’s proposal.\n",

            "Tesla (TSLA) - Get Tesla Inc Report posted a new record for sales, beat analyst estimates for profits and offered a rosy picture of how it will fare in the near-term, even amid supply chain bottlenecks and rising inflation. \n",
            "The question and answer portion after the call is always closely watched. In it, the company's chief executive and its chief financial officer fielded inquiries from investors and analysts.\n",
            "You can read that full exchange below.\n",
            "Moderator:\n",
            "During the question and answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue. Before we jump into Q&A, Zach will have some opening remarks. Zach.\n",
            "\n",
            "Zach Kirkhorn:\n",
            "Yeah. Thanks, Martin. Just to start off here, Q1 was a challenging but extremely successful quarter for the company. Despite numerous plant interruptions, including shutdowns at our Shanghai factory and nearby suppliers due to Covid, we've continued making progress and achieved our best ever vehicle deliveries. \n",
            "Last quarter, we demonstrated a series of new financial records, including revenue, gross margins, operating margin and bottom-line profitability. Gap automotive gross margin reached 32.9%, and for the first time exceeded 30% when excluding regulatory credits. Higher pricing continues to positively impact our financials, as we make progress delivering cars in our growing backlog.\n",
            "\n",
            "Zach Kirkhorn:\n",
            "Note that for most vehicles, our delivery wait times are quite long. Those cars delivered in Q1 generally carried pricing set in prior quarters, and at levels lower than cars being ordered today. Our per unit vehicle costs increased as well. Inflation, raw material prices, expedites and logistics costs continues to impact our cost structure. Factory shutdowns also occurred with little to notice, hence we are unable to take action to plan those interruptions in a cost-efficient manner. \n",
            "Additionally, we saw a slight mix shift towards more profitable vehicles, including the Model Y. We also recognized a one-time benefit of 288 million from credit revenue relating to a regulatory change in the US CAFE penalty, without of which, credit revenue would've declined compared to the same period last year.\n",
            "\n",
            "Zach Kirkhorn:\n",
            "The energy business has continued to be impacted by macro conditions more severely than the vehicle business. Our storage products are in need of chip supply, and new import processes have impacted supply of certain components for our solar systems, which is reflected in our solar volume for the quarter. OPEX, as a percentage of revenue, continues to reduce and driven by higher revenue, lower stock based comp expense and other items. \n",
            "As a result of our ongoing improvements and operating leverage, we achieved a record operating margin of over 19%. We note that commissioning costs for our factories are in R&D, as Berlin started production in late March and Austin in early April. These costs will be an automotive cost going forward, given these factories are now producing customer-sellable cars.\n",
            "\n",
            "Zach Kirkhorn:\n",
            "Our free cash flows have remained quite strong, yet were impacted by working capital related to lower than planned production. Additionally, we have reduced our debt excluding product financing to nearly zero. Looking ahead in the immediate term, a few things to keep in mind for Q2. \n",
            "First, we've lost about a month of build volume out of our factory in Shanghai due to COVID-related shutdowns. Production is resuming at limited levels, and we're working to get back to full production as quickly as possible. This will impact total build and delivery volume in Q2.\n",
            "\n",
            "Zach Kirkhorn:\n",
            "Second, as I've mentioned before, Austin and Berlin are just starting their ramps, and thus those inefficiencies will start to flow through our gross margins in Q2.\n",
            "\n",
            "Zach Kirkhorn:\n",
            "Third, we do have of higher ASPs in our backlog, which will help to offset some of these headwinds. We continue to drive towards further strengthening of our financials in the second half of the year, and believe our 50% or above growth rate remains achievable for the year. I want to conclude by thanking the Tesla team, our suppliers, and our new customers for a great first quarter.\n",
            "\n",
            "Moderator:\n",
            "Thank you very much. And Elon has some opening remarks as well.\n",
            "\n",
            "Elon:\n",
            "Sure. Some of my remarks will be redundant with Zach's, but it's maybe worth repeating. Q1 was once again a record quarter on many levels by reaching the highest deliveries of profit and an operating margin of 19%. This was despite a lot of chip shortages, many logistics challenges, and an overall difficult quarter. \n",
            "So I'd really like to congratulate the Tesla team on achieving record profitability and output, despite many, many difficult headwinds. And especially, the Tesla China team and our Shanghai factory. They really had significant challenges due to the COVID shutdown, and none the less, have been able to output a trimester of high-quality vehicles. And we are already back up and running with the Shanghai factory.\n",
            "\n",
            "Elon:\n",
            "So as Zach said, we remain confident of a 50% growth in vehicle production in 2022 versus '21. I think we actually have a reasonable shot at a 60% increase over last year. Let's see. Obviously, production, as people know, with Giga Berlin and Giga Texas, in the past few months. So we've two fantastic factories with great teams, and they are ramping rapidly. Now, with new factories, the initial ramp always looks small, but it grows exponentially. But I have very high confidence in the teams of both factories, and we expect to ramp those initially slowly, but like I said, growing exponentially, with them achieving high volume by the end of this year.\n",
            "\n",
            "Elon:\n",
            "Let's see. We're also working on a new vehicle that I alluded to at the Giga Texas opening, which is a dedicated Robotaxi, that's highly optimized for autonomy, meaning it would not have steering wheel or pedals. And there are a number of other innovations around it that I think are quite exciting, but it's fundamentally optimized. It's trying to achieve the lowest fully considered cost per mile, cost per kilometer, accounting everything. And so it's I think going to be a very powerful product. Where we aspire to reach volume production of that in 2024. So I think that really will be a massive driver of Tesla's growth.\n",

And I say heartfelt thanks to the suppliers that have really worked day and night to ensure that Tesla is able to keep the factories running. \n",

But Tesla Shanghai, Giga Shanghai is coming back with a vengeance. So I think not withstanding new issues that arise, I think we will see a record output per week from Giga Shanghai this quarter, albeit we are missing a couple weeks. So that means the most likely vehicle production in Q2 will be similar to Q1, maybe slightly lower. \n",

From the point in which you have a factory complete and you're making a small number of units, to the point where it's producing high-quality vehicles in volume is nine to 12 months from start of production. So now, hopefully, we're getting better at that ramp, so maybe it's a little less. But to get to the 5,000 a week level has typically taken us around 12 months from start of production. Yeah.\n",

And some of the vehicles that people will order, the wait list extends into next year. \n",
            "So our prices of vehicles ordered now are really anticipating supplier and logistics cost growth that we're aware of, and believe will happen over the next six to 12 months.

Not everything is better. And so we look at that platform and we're not ignoring the reality that you could go to a higher voltage, but there's nothing really encouraging us to do so on that platform.

So the advantages are small, and the cost is high. Say long term, years from now, does it make sense probably to move to an 800 volt architecture? Probably.

On utilities and personnel, we know what those loads are and how many people are needed to run what is basically in a highly optimized factory. And we have massive reductions in both of those.

Just what is the tonnage of lithium that you need, of nickel, of iron phosphate, of graphite, separators, electrolytes, that look like ... Really think of just macro tonnage. \n",

We rerun any plastic that goes out.

            "Dan Levy:\n",
            "Hi, good evening. Thank you for taking the questions. The questions first, maybe you can just talk through or address what some of the drivers of cost improvement were in the quarter? Was it just further improvements within Shanghai or in Fremont? Anything around sort of ongoing Kaizen that you've talked about in the past? You could just talk through what you benefited from in the first quarter.\n",
            "\n",
            "Zach Kirkhorn:\n",
            "Sure. I mean at a high level, cars produced in Shanghai do carry a lower cost structure than cars produced in Fremont. And so as our mix of cars shift towards Shanghai, the average cost is positively impacted by that. We're also seeing some progress in manufacturing efficiencies in Fremont, particularly on the SNX side, as volume increases improves there. Expedites has been a huge story for the company Q4. We had massive amounts of expedites. Q1 was still quite large, but we did make progress bringing that down some.\n",
            "\n",
            "Elon:\n",
            "To mention like to the manufacturing team and our associates there, because we're achieving record output at Fremont.\n",
            "\n",
            "Zach Kirkhorn:\n",
            "Yeah. The Fremont team is doing a tremendous job, absolutely.\n",

            "Dan Levy:\n",
            "It's hard to under underweight, like you should expedite situation with the crazy logistics that occurred with COVID.\n",
            "\n",
            "Zach Kirkhorn:\n",
            "And, to Elon's point, the Fremont team and also the Shanghai team has been extremely dynamic with the unpredictable nature of our part rivals and our supply chain team and particular production planning portion of supply team supply chain. We often get very little notice when there's part shortages coming and it's kind of a scramble couple days before that part is supposed to arrive to figure out how to get it here. And so the amount of herculean effort that goes in to produce a quarter like Q1 and even the quarters before that is absolutely immense.\n",
            "\n",
            "Elon:\n",
            "So it's like the saying in the military or, it's like amateurs talk about tactics, professionals talk about logistics when it comes to war.\n",
            "\n",
            "Zach Kirkhorn:\n",
            "Yeah. You know, so there were some inherent cost improvements as I mentioned, but you know, there's also offsets that we've talked about previously and raw materials, commodities, outbound logistics continues to remain a challenge despite a ton of efforts to increase capacity there and bring those costs down.\n",
            "\n",
            "Dan Levy:\n",
            "Second question. One of the initial goals of model three way back when was to have an EV that was affordable for a wide portion of the market and, we know prices are much higher now just given the supply constraints, prices are higher for all of the car makers. We know that there's inflation that you're battling through and some of that needs to be passed through to the price of the vehicles. And you're going to be supply constraint for the foreseeable future. So it's sort of a moot point, but given the goal long term of making EVs more widely available to the masses over time, how do you look at the progression of prices over time?\n",
            "\n",
            "Elon:\n",
            "We absolutely want to make EVs as affordable as possible. It's been very difficult with the, I mean, I think inflation is that like 40 or 50 year high. And I think the official numbers actually understate the true magnitude of inflation. And that inflation appears to be likely to continue for at least the remainder of this year. When we're talking to suppliers, suppliers understood cost pressure. So yeah, and in some cases we're seeing suppliers request 20 to 30% cost increases for parts from last year to the end of the end of this year. So there's a lot of cost pressure there.\n",
            "\n",
            "Elon:\n",
            "That's why we raise our prices. Because when things with respect to inflation, if you know it's high then, and we've got orders that go out a year or more in some cases, then we have to anticipate those cost increases. But I think especially with the Robotaxi and autonomy, I think we'll end up providing consumers with by far the lowest cost per mile of transport that they've ever experienced. Yeah. And you know, with the Robotaxi like maybe five to 10 times or cost per mile, it's really quite substantial.\n",

            "\n",

            "I mean looking at some of our projections, it would appear that a Robotaxi ride will cost less than a bus ticket or subsidized subway ticket.\n",

            "Moderator:\n",
            "Thank you very much. Let's go to the next question from Rod Lache from Wolfe Research.\n",
            "\n",
            "Rod Lache:\n",
            "Hi everybody. I'm trying to just parse out your comments about the inflation and constraint supply and battery feed and the initiatives that you are working on internally to secure these materials. It sounds like you're optimistic about Tesla's ability to solve this for Tesla. But do you see this as a constraint on EV adoption more broadly?\n",
            "\n",
            "Elon:\n",
            "Yeah, absolutely. But you know, what sort of keeping our costs down at least in the short term is that we have long term contracts with suppliers, but those long term contracts will obviously run out and then, we'll start to see potentially significant cost increases, but looking at the world as a whole and saying, okay, what does it take for earth to transition to sustainable energy faster? It's fundamentally... The fundamental living factor is the output of the cell, the basically cell output. At what rate can lithium ion cells increase the gig one hours per year, that is the fundamental limiting factor.\n",
            "\n",
            "Elon:\n",
            "And that will move as fast as the lowest least lucky element of the whole supply chain. Currently we see as being a challenge with lithium. To be clear, it's not that there's a shortage of lithium ore in the world. Lithium is present almost everywhere. It's a very common element. However, you still need to dig up the, or take up basically large mean or whatever with the clay, with the lithium. And, then you need to go through a whole series of refinement steps. And that's a lot of industrial equipment that's needed to go to refine lithium ore to lithium, that can be used as lithium hydroxide or lithium carbonate in a battery cell.\n",
            "\n",
            "Elon:\n",
            "So we think we're going to need to help the industry on this front. But the industry is very, very fast. So they encourage entrepreneurs out there, both looking for opportunities to get into the lithium business. The lithium margins right now are practically software margins. I think this there's a, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think we're seeing cases where the spot lithium price is 10 times higher than the cost of extraction. So not like we're talking 90% margins here. Can more people please get into the lithium business. Do you like minting money? Well, lithium business is for you.\n",
            "\n",
            "Rod Lache:\n",
            "Interesting. So I guess we'll stay tuned to see what happens from that. My second question is, its impressive to see just the modest increase in cost per vehicle, cost goods sold per vehicle, given what we've seen in terms of commodities actually, and from here, you have a lot of savings opportunities with 4680 cells, and the cell manufacturing changes, chemistry structural packs, giga castings. Are you suggesting that even those may not be sufficient to offset the inflation that you're seeing? And that you're going to need additional pricing as well. In addition to those specific initiatives that you've called out?\n",
            "\n",
            "Elon:\n",
            "We hope we don't need to increase the pricing further. The current pricing is anticipating what we think is the probable growth in costs. And if that growth in cost does not materialize, we actually may slightly reduce prices. So currently anticipate making significant price increases. But, obviously we don't control the macroeconomic environment if governments keep printing vast amounts of money. And, if they're not significant increases in lithium extraction and refinement and the other raw materials such that everyone's competing for a limited amount of raw materials, then obviously that will try our prices to high levels.\n",
            "\n",
            "Elon:\n",
            "So if you have a principal that can tell us what the future going to be like, we'll just accordingly, but the current prices are for a vehicle delivered in the future, like six to 12 months from now. So this is our best guess.\n",
            "\n",
            "Zach Kirkhorn:\n",
            "But I think if you zoom out, right, as you said, our mission is to accelerate the transition of sustainable energy. So we are working with our existing suppliers and others to figure out how to grow all of these raw materials as quickly as possible to not slow down the transition.\n",
            "\n",

            "Zach Kirkhorn:\n",
            "And whether that means we have to get directly involved in some cases or not comes down to the counterparty and their willingness to expand at the rate, we think they should be able to expand. That's similar to what we've done with everything else. Like we built a Gigafactory in Reno because it needed to be done.\n",

Because my understanding, it takes many years to build that out. So are we just sort of facing... When do you think we see a lithium shortage or a nickel shortage and is there even enough time to build that mining capacity in place? And then related, how quickly can you switch to LFP for the nickel issue?\n",
            "\n",
            "Zach Kirkhorn:\n",
            "Yeah. I'll take the LFP question and it says so in our letter, but half of our products were LFP last quarter, which shows how quickly we were able to respond to, well, honestly it wasn't because of a raw material shortage, but just because it seemed like the right thing to do, we could change our [cathode 00:53:50] chemistry. And there's more to be done on the cathode side and we are actively pursuing it to give us substitution flexibility in response to market conditions between the other cathodes out there that can be competitive in our vehicles, of which there are many options.\n",
            "\n",
            "Zach Kirkhorn:\n",
            "I guess what I would say is, specifically on the cathode side, flexibility is the way we're going to achieve this. And not all of the materials that go into cathodes are actually, first of all, hard to secure through mining or refining. And second of all, in many cases are very plentiful already, huge scale. And if all of the batteries in the world use those cathodes, it's less than a 1% increase in total annual output. That's the cathode side. \n",
            "I think Elon already spent a lot of time talking about lithium. It's really depends on the resource. Some resources, just getting rocks out of the ground, expanding the amount of rocks that you're getting out of the ground is maybe a little bit of paperwork and some additional blasting and trucking operations. \n",
            "The refining is maybe where there's, it's a little bit more chunky to bring it online, but also the refining doesn't, it's not like an oil refinery. It's a much smaller operation to refine lithium [inaudible 00:55:16] or liquid, like brine or a salt pond evaporation.\n",

Some of what's going on in the lithium market this year, doesn't actually have truth to bear to the fundamentals of supply and demand, which is also a little frustrating. \n",
            "Yeah. If we look past this year or next year into 2030, when we need 15 to 20 [inaudible 00:55:57] of this stuff to get on the growth trajectory, stay on the growth trajectory we're on, we need everybody to do more in the lithium space than they currently are.

Certainly, really important to have a good experience for Tesla owners in terms of wait times or charging stalls, but if Tesla's able to have enough capacity, it could be a really good way to bring other vehicle owners into the Tesla network, perhaps help Tesla to sustain its network benefits and maybe make more people likely to buy Tesla vehicles in the future.\n",

Are there any metrics you can share on what take rates have been like and how do profitability margins on the insurance offering compared to the corporate average? Thank you.\n",
            "\n",
            "Zach Kirkhorn:\n",
            "So we just launched Tesla Insurance for realtime insurance in Virginia, Colorado, and Oregon earlier this week. Maybe one step that I'll share is that Texas is our longest standing realtime insurance market. But based upon the information that we have, Tesla is the second largest insurer of Teslas in the state of Texas. \n",
            "And possibly by the end of this quarter, maybe early next quarter, we'll be the largest insurer of Tesla's. And so the customer reception to this has been quite positive. And I was reading social media on Monday after we launched in the three new states, a lot of folks who are reporting their stories of saving quite substantial amounts of money relative to their previous insurance. And so we're quite encouraged by that. And we're working as quickly as we can to get to 80% of customers having access to a Tesla Insurance product by the end of this year in the United States.\n",
            "\n",
            "Zach Kirkhorn:\n",
            "At which point, we'll pivot our attention to expansion outside of the U.S. The other thing I'll say on insurance is, with these three new states, the model is different because we are now the underwriter and we are also now holding the risk. And so with those states, we are a fully vertically integrated provider of insurance from systems and financials. With respect to the financials of the program, it's still very early. And so as the program gets more scale, I'm happy to share more information on that.\n",
            "\n",
            "Elon:\n",
            "And one side note is that we are seeing that the, having realtime feedback for driving habits is actually resulting in Tesla owners driving the cars in a safer way. Because they can see the, they get realtime feedback on, okay, this is affecting my insurance rate or it isn't. \n",
            "And so when people can see a real time score and realize, oh, if I make the following changes in my driving habits, then I pay less in insurance, then they have a very, a realtime feedback loop for driving, for safer driving and an incentive to do so. So it is actually, what we're seeing is, it is causing people to drive their cars in a safer manner, which is also [inaudible 01:00:51].\n",
            "\n",
            "Zach Kirkhorn:\n",
            "It's safer on average, what we see in the data, to Elon's point, and premiums are lower. We see that in the take break data. We have extremely high retention for customers who experience the product. And I think I've talked about this in the past, but this has become a real passion program for us.\n",
            "\n",
            "Elon:\n",
            "Yeah.\n",

            "\n",
            "Elon:\n",
            "Yeah. I think it improves just overall macro economic efficiency. It's also a feedback loop for Tesla because we see if there is a crash, large or small, we sort of see exactly what that cost. And now we're, okay, think about how can we change the design of the car or the software in order to minimize the probability of that accident.\n",
            "Because most accidents or minor, but how those accidents occur less frequently and how do we make the repair associated with that accident super fast. Aspirationally, it'd be same day repair from road collision, which is just night and day difference compared to sometimes having to wait for a month while insurance claims are settled and figured out. Because Tesla's also doing collision repair.\n",
            "\n",
            "Zach Kirkhorn:\n",
            "Yeah. The feedback loop is instant.\n",

            "We do claims management in-house and so we receive the notification that there's an accident. We work to prepare the estimate and we can, with the support of our customers, use our collision centers to do the repair.\n",

            "Zach Kirkhorn:\n",
            "And so it's full end-to-end visibility and all of that, to Elon's point, we can then identify areas of cost and efficiency, feed those back to engineering teams or elsewhere, software teams, actually improve the product, which lowers the cost of insurance and improves reliability of the product. So it's a full circle.\n",
            "\n",
            "Elon:\n",
            "Yeah. Basically the customer experience is just vastly better because if there's an accident, there's no argument, we repair it immediately. And this is as compared to arguing with an insurance company and then a claims adjuster, and then a collision repair center. And this can be a nightmare, basically. So we're to try to turn a nightmare into [inaudible 01:03:25] insurance.\n",

            "Speaker 2:\n",
            "All right. Hey everybody. Let me know if you can hear me. Sometimes there have been small audio issues here, but I just want to do a quick recap of that call, some of the big things that we heard. So I'm just going to keep an eye on the chat here until it catches up and then we can do a quick recap. I am feeling very good about what Tesla is doing here. It's really exciting. This is a very exciting quarter. I think there's a lot to be happy about with the financial results, which, if you didn't see my reaction to that. There is a link to that in the description. You can go check that out. Looks like the audio's good. That's great. Yeah. Financials are great.\n",
            "\n",
            "Speaker 2:\n",
            "What Tesla's talking about doing here in terms of just their product roadmap, the plan for the next decade, plus, it's so difficult to not be a extremely excited about that. Obviously there's a lot of execution that remains, but we have seen Tesla do an amazing job of executing on their targets so far. Yeah. It's very exciting. I think just from a recency bias perspective, talk about Tesla Insurance here, that's just such a good example of what Tesla does. \n",
            "They find things that are inefficient and then they just, somehow, despite all the things that Tesla has to juggle all the time, they do a really great job of tackling those things and finding improvements, and just thinking from, again, Elon always talks about it, thinking from a first principal's perspective to solve problems and make the world better. It's awesome to see. Exciting about that.\n",
            "\n",
            "Speaker 2:\n",
            "I think the biggest thing from the call here is, just since we already went through the financials, I think, obviously Tesla's making great improvements on cost. So it's exciting just fundamentally, they're starting to leverage, they've been doing that for the last two years now. What we've been talking about, about this leverage coming through, we're really starting to see that %5 billion in EBITDA this quarter. Tesla, no debt, they talked about. Pierre's question about the four or $500 billion on the balance sheet at the end of the decade. \n",
            "And Elon laughs and says, \"Oh, who knows how much that's going to be worth.\" But I would imagine Tesla's projections are actually a little bit higher than that, but I think Zach makes a great point, take it one step at a time, that's how Tesla's approaching things. And when they get to that point with the robotaxis on the road, printing money or [Optimis 01:09:04] is out there, hopefully printing money as well.\n",
            "\n",
            "Speaker 2:\n",
            "Elon always says that once you have, you only pay a dividend, I don't think he's said explicitly stock buybacks, but he says, once you pay a dividend, it's because you're out of ways to spend money. You can feel Elon's tone on that shifting a little bit, or his commentary around that. And I think that's based on what Tesla thinks is going to happen here. So point being that I do think once those things are in place and once Tesla at a certain point, you just can't spend that money quickly enough. \n",
            "I look forward to those questions, well, I don't, but I'm sure in some future year, we're going to see questions about what Tesla needs to do with its massive cash balance and investors really harping to get that returned. And I do think at some point that's going to happen and Tesla will be able to continue investing in the future, and also just print money for investors too.\n",
            "\n",
            "Speaker 2:\n",
            "So it's an exciting future from a product perspective, it's an exciting future from a financial perspective. And again, Tesla just needs to execute on that. The roadmap is quite clear. All right. So let's just look through some of the notes here. I'm going to just go back to the top here. And thanks for the super chats, by the way. I definitely appreciate those. Hopefully the notes here are helpful. All right. So I think from the opening comments, a lot of that stuff, we've gone through. The regulatory credit. \n",
            "This was something I considered in my forecast. I probably should have just put it in there, but we had talked about this a couple times on the podcast that there had been the change in the, basically the law from 2017 to 2021, that had been reversed and caused extra, more strictness in terms of the fleet-wide efficiency metrics for automakers in the US, and probably should have anticipated that would cause some extra regulatory [inaudible 01:08:10] revenue for Tesla. Does that make sense? We can factor that out later on.\n",
            "\n",
            "Speaker 2:\n",
            "Opex, it's all great. No debt. Lost about a month out of Shanghai. So Elon said something here that was very surprising. We'll have to dig into the spreadsheets to figure this out, but let's find Elon's comments here. He said that they're still going to be able to, and maybe I didn't quite get it in the notes, but he said for Shanghai that even though they've been down for almost the entire month of April, now they, oh, I guess, two thirds of the month, they still think that for the quarter, they can hit similar levels of production as Q1 here. So that would be great. We'll have to put that into our production tracking spreadsheet and just see what that means from a weekly production standpoint. But that suggests that there's going to be significant progress-\n",
            "\n",
            "Rob Maurer:\n",
            "... But that suggests that there's going to be significant progress. Tesla should be making production line upgrades in May and hopefully that will result in really good production for June, and then further upgrades in July is the current information.\n",
            "\n",
            "Rob Maurer:\n",
            "So, those things are really going to improve the production rate and sounds like that's going to make up for some of the lost volume here in April, which is really exciting because we can see that at this level Tesla's financials are very strong.\n",
            "\n",
            "Rob Maurer:\n",
            "They did mention that Berlin and Texas, although didn't have a huge impact this quarter, has acted specifically say that probably for next quarter, that is going to cause a hit to gross margin. That doesn't necessarily mean gross margin would be down, but he seemed to emphasize that more of that would be coming next quarter and I think a lot of that would be the start of 46 80s hitting cogs as well.\n",
            "\n",
            "Rob Maurer:\n",
            "So this is the one thing that I bolded. I don't usually bold stuff, but I just felt like I had to here. Because Elon talking about the dedicated robotaxi; he mentioned this on the master plan and that was the first inclination that Tesla would be shifting from driving down on the cost curve for a consumer model, $25,000.00 vehicle to going straight to the Servo taxi type of a situation.\n",
            "\n",
            "Rob Maurer:\n",
            "And now Elon giving us a timeline on that, saying perhaps failing that next year and aspire to reach volume production of that in 2024. And it's already 2022. We're already in Q2 of 2022, so that's two years, maybe two years and six months. But that's very soon. I mean the Cybertruck was unveiled less time ago or more time ago than that would be from now.\n",
            "\n",
            "Rob Maurer:\n",
            "It's been two and a half years since the Cybertruck unveiling so I guess it would be about the same. So we're pretty close. The Cybertruck unveiling to me doesn't feel that long ago, obviously the delays make it feel a little bit longer, but we're pretty close.\n",
            "\n",
            "Rob Maurer:\n",
            "The one thing I want to add on this is that this does become then a risk for... If you don't think Tesla can solve FSD, if you don't think they're going to actually be able to do level four type of driving in that timeframe, it presents risk to Tesla's roadmap until that is solved. And I think from an institutional investor perspective, a lot of institutional investors would probably prefer that Tesla talked about having plans for [inaudible 01:11:28] vehicles beyond the Model 3 and the Model Y that are meant for purchase by consumers. I think one of the analysts even asked, \"Can people buy that?\" \n",
            "I don't think they got a clear answer on that, but this, over the next two, three years, this is going to be a super hot topic of debate and the cause of conflict between Tesla and Wall Street, until Wall Street starts to believe that \"Oh, FSD is actually solved or very close to being solved or solvable.\" We're not at that point yet where Wall Street believes that. I think that's still fair.\n",
            "\n",
            "Rob Maurer:\n",
            "What's already happening; you can hear from the analyst on these calls; is they're trying to figure out how to build their models for 2024, 2025 and beyond. And when you've got a $25,000 Tesla on the roadmap, you can very easily build a model for that because you can just look at what Tesla's done with the Model 3 and the Model Y. \n",
            "You can make some cost assumptions and just plug that into a spreadsheet and all of it looks great. When that product suddenly falls off and then you replace it with this dedicated robotaxi; which these analysts aren't going to model earnings for because they can't back it up because Tesla hasn't solved this problem yet, that creates a whole giant set of question marks in where Tesla is heading.\n",
            "\n",
            "Rob Maurer:\n",
            "So it's going to cause some tension, conflict. We're just going to keep getting questions about what this looks like until it's solved. Because it creates a lot of risk for Tesla to go directly to a robot taxi from where they're at. And personally, I think Tesla would mitigate that risk just with Model 3 and Model Y. I don't think analysts are really understanding how high Tesla's going to go the volume for those vehicles and they can drive the prices down accordingly.\n",
            "\n",
            "Rob Maurer:\n",
            "So I think that's where Tesla's mitigating that. But even still, on those vehicles, there's probably some ceiling and that ceiling is probably below 20 million. So it's becomes a big question mark of how you get to 20 million if Robotaxis don't happen. So probably being a little bit wordy on that topic, but hopefully that makes sense.\n",
            "\n",
            "Rob Maurer:\n",
            "It's just going to be a constant battle with Elon saying, \"Oh, we're doing Robotaxis, Wall Street saying, \"How are you going to keep growing volume at 50% if you don't solve this?\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Rob Maurer:\n",
            "So still aspire ahead to 20 millions per year. Basically 5% the way there. I would say they're probably closer to a 2 million production rate now than 1 million, when they actually have production fully up and running, so call it 10%.\n",
            "\n",
            "Rob Maurer:\n",
            "Optimist Elon, again, just reiterating people don't get it. Same thing there. People get the impact that this would have they just don't believe that Tesla's going to be able to pull this off. So same thing on that in terms of the push and pull with Wall Street. But I think it's very easy to understand the impact that would have and the financial benefit that could have as well.\n",
            "\n",
            "Rob Maurer:\n",
            "Insurance growing well. I see timelines. I wish they would've shared something on interventions per mile or something like that. Elon basically just saying, \"Use the beta.\" I've been on the beta for, I don't know, six to seven to eight months. We've talked about this before. I think on an individual basis, it is difficult to assess progress. I definitely think things have improved, which is exciting. \n",
            "And we've talked before about how there are probably a lot of underlying factors that are improving, that we just can't quite see, that Elon has visibility to, and an understanding of, and that shapes his experience and his context when he is experiencing FSD Beta. Even if he's on the same exact version that consumers are on, which most of the time he is not, he's usually using the alpha version, so we have to consider that when we consider his comments too, even having the same experience.\n",
            "\n",
            "Rob Maurer:\n",
            "So I guess from my perspective, I'm relatively neutral on FSD Beta progress. It has progressed, but coming into the beta, I would've hoped that it would've happened faster. But hopefully there are things behind the scenes that are actually happening at that rate. That will become more apparent, especially when we get to version 11.\n",
            "\n",
            "Rob Maurer:\n",
            "Again, thinks they'll achieve real-world AI this year. Shanghai coming back with vengeance so most likely vehicle production Q2 will be on par with Q1. It wasn't clear if he meant total production, worldwide production or just Shanghai. It doesn't really matter though, too much, because... Fremont wasn't super constrained. So if he means Shanghai, then Fremont should do a similar output and then worldwide would therefore be similar. If you only mean Shanghai, it ends up being the same thing. So not particularly important, but basically that means if Shanghai can do it, then the world can do it as well, in terms of the production.\n",
            "\n",
            "Rob Maurer:\n",
            "It also sounded like some pretty decent updates from the supply chain in China. I think that's been one of the risks that we've had a lot of uncertainty on and I think they clarified a lot around that. It sounds like they're not super worried about that beyond just the general challenges that are happening this year.\n",
            "\n",
            "Rob Maurer:\n",
            "A lot about pricing, [inaudible 01:17:04] architecture. That was pretty interesting. I don't think we really need to recap any of that though. In general I think there were pretty good questions about this call. Definitely some eye-rollers and I apologize for my reaction to some of those questions. Particularly with the one about costs and prices to consumer. Obviously robotaxi's Tesla's plan to address that. That's been clear for a decade. Not quite that long, but at least five years.\n",
            "\n",
            "Rob Maurer:\n",
            "Lithium, talked a lot about that. Not sure we need to go too much detail on that. So faster ramps in Berlin and Austin. Now this is a little bit surprising because the buildout for Berlin and Austin took quite a bit longer than Shanghai. You could call it about two times the amount of time.\n",
            "\n",
            "Rob Maurer:\n",
            "Hopefully that also means that once it is actually ready to start production, it's able to ramp up more quickly. That's what they're thinking. I'm not super convinced on that yet, just based on 46 80's. Tesla's still not in volume production, they're hoping to get there in Q3, Q4. Which obviously that would be great, that would be exciting. \n",
            "We'll have to model that out a little bit too, but my expectations are, are tampered a little bit, just with that new technology and all the supply chain stuff. They didn't say it on this call, but the last couple of calls they've said that overall their production is constrained. In previous [inaudible 01:18:32] they could have produced more vehicles from Fremont and Shanghai so if that's the case, then you've got new factories; that doesn't really change. So that could be a factor limiting the production ramps of these new factories as well.\n",
            "\n",
            "Rob Maurer:\n",
            "They did say that they've got plenty of 2170 packs though, so that's definitely good because that was one of the things that was maybe a concern for Berlin for the next couple of quarters, is okay with these shutdowns in China, is that going to actually impact the availability of 2170 packs, which we know they're using from China in Berlin right now. But it doesn't sound like that's the case. So that's an exciting point.\n",
            "\n",
            "Rob Maurer:\n",
            "A little bit more on robotaxi and then the analyst questions, which we already talked about, some of those things.\n",

            "Alex Potter's question on the CEO compensation plan. It doesn't sound like Elon is planning to do another compensation plan. And in my model, I don't have one forecast. I think I would certainly be supportive of one, but I think Elon is content with his level of wealth from Tesla in his share count, as it stands, at this point. \n",
            "So he's got strong incentive to continue to make Tesla work well and be financially successful from those shares. Which once the shares are vested, he needs to hold them for five years from this most recent plan. So he's going to be sticking around for a while, even without any other plan.\n",

            "Rob Maurer:\n",
            "Supercharge network, it's going well. Tesla insurance. I mean, we started there, but yeah... Super exciting with Tesla insurance. It sounds like the take rates high, the actual improvement in driver safety, that's the biggest cost of insurance. So the fewer accidents is going to make Tesla's margins or the cost on that, same thing. \n",
            "We talk about always driving in the same direction, up-down, so it's good on that. I think I'm very excited about Tesla insurance and the fact that they're fully vertically integrated now and doing the underwriting. Partially explains to why they're keeping a lot of cash on hand. If you grow insurance to a huge scale, you're going to need some cash for that.\n",

Even with those fees for expediting, we are still seeing an all-time high automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits of 30%. So a lot of strong, fundamental progress, at the same time that's all happening. Tesla's keeping their operating expenses under control. \n",
            "The operating margin of 19%; yes, that does include the regulatory credits, but even extracting that out, Tesla is by far now at this point, the highest profitability automaker in the world. And as they say in their earnings deck, as they keep trying to hint at on the calls, more and more of their revenue is going to, or more and more of their profitability is going to come from software, and that's going to be high margin.\n",

Q4, my gap and non-gap earnings per share numbers, those were slightly inflated, because, in my model, I had been playing around with it and I'd removed the 340 million payroll tax from Q4. So that was inflated by 30 cents. So if you are using that number, the trailing 12 months gap earnings per share is now 737, not 766 like Ed said.\n",

Look at Lars's response on comparing the Cybertruck to other pickup trucks. He's like, \"Oh, I didn't even think about that, because it's just like, so irrelevant to what Tesla's doing.\" It just shows how core two Tesla's thinking first principles is. They're not looking at any of that competition; quote, unquote competition, because they just don't care. They know that their path is better and they're just trying to make that path as good as possible. So that's just an indicator of what is to come.\n",

            "I lost my train of thought a little bit. Just major recap. So I think the financial progress that Tesla's making is excellent. The roadmap is extremely exciting, though slightly more uncertain now, because of Tesla's more apparent shift into pushing all their chips in on Robotaxi, which we haven't seen come to fruition yet.\n",
            " So could create some good opportunities if Tesla gets a new period where they haven't figured this out yet, and growth is not quite happening because they went all in on this Robotaxi and they're not going to, I mean, maybe they would, but ... If they have this production plan for a couple of million, a few million Robotaxis, and they haven't solved FSD yet, I don't know how they're going to sell those.\n",

            "So that's where the big question for Wall Street comes in. Hopefully 6, 12, months from now, 18 months, we won't have to worry about that. Hopefully Elon's right, in this case. It's not something I would bet on. Well, I guess I kind of embed on it. But the reason that I bet on it is because I think Tesla's business just, even excluding those things, is so strong. Super clear roadmap to multi-trillion-dollar valuation just from vehicles. And if Tesla can figure out anything real-world AI related, just adds to that.\n",
            "\n",
            "Rob Maurer:\n",
            "In summary, great financials. Really strong, fundamental progress. Robotaxi is super exciting, but also going to present a little bit of conflict with Wall Street. So that where we're going to leave it then. I'm sure we'll have a little bit more discussion on this tomorrow so make sure you are subscribed and sign up for notifications. You can also find me on Twitter @TeslaPodcast and we'll see you tomorrow for the Thursday, April 21st episode of Tesla Daily. Thank you.\n",

            "Twitter Inc. TWTR 3.93% is re-examining Elon Musk’s $43 billion takeover offer after the billionaire lined up financing for the bid, in a sign the social-media company could be more receptive to a deal.\n",
            "Twitter had been expected to rebuff the offer, which Mr. Musk made earlier this month without saying how he would pay for it. But after he disclosed last week that he now has $46.5 billion in financing, Twitter is taking a fresh look at the offer and is more likely than before to seek to negotiate, people familiar with the matter said. The situation is fast-moving and it is still far from guaranteed Twitter will do so.\n",
            "Twitter is still working on an all-important estimate of its own value, which would need to come in close to Mr. Musk’s offer, and it could also insist on sweeteners such as Mr. Musk agreeing to cover breakup protections should the deal fall apart, some of the people said.\n",

            "Twitter is expected to weigh in on the bid when it reports first-quarter earnings Thursday, if not sooner, the people said. Twitter’s response won’t necessarily be black-and-white, and could leave the door open for inviting other bidders or negotiating with Mr. Musk on terms other than price. Mr. Musk reiterated to Twitter’s chairman Bret Taylor in recent days that he won’t budge from his offer of $54.20-a-share, the people said.\n",

            "The potential turnabout on Twitter’s part comes after Mr. Musk met privately Friday with several shareholders of the company to extol the virtues of his proposal while repeating that the board has a “yes-or-no” decision to make, according to people familiar with the matter. He also pledged to solve the free-speech issues he sees as plaguing the platform and the country more broadly, whether his bid succeeds or not, they said.\n",
            "The Tesla Inc. TSLA -0.37% chief executive made his pitch to select shareholders in a series of video calls, with a focus on actively managed funds, the people said, in hopes that they could sway the company’s decision.\n",
            "Mr. Musk said he sees no way Twitter management can get the stock to his offer price on its own, given the issues in the business and a persistent inability to correct them. It couldn’t be learned if he detailed specific steps he would take, though he has tweeted about wanting to reduce the platform’s reliance on advertising, as well as to make simpler changes such as allowing longer tweets.\n",
            "Mr. Musk already has some shareholders rallying behind him following the meetings. Lauri Brunner, who manages Thrivent Asset Management LLC’s large-cap growth fund, sees Mr. Musk as a skilled operator. “He has an established track record at Tesla,” she said. “He is the catalyst to deliver strong operating performance at Twitter.” Minneapolis-based Thrivent has a roughly 0.4% stake in Twitter worth $160 million and is also a Tesla shareholder.\n",
            "Mr. Musk already has said he is considering taking his bid directly to shareholders by launching a tender offer. Even if he was to get significant shareholder support in a tender offer—which is far from guaranteed—he would still need a way around the company’s poison pill, a legal maneuver it employed that effectively blocks him from building his stake to 15% or more.\n",

            "One oft-employed tactic to push a bid, seeking to gain control of the target’s board, is out of reach for now. Twitter’s directors have staggered terms, meaning a dissident shareholder would need multiple years to gain control rather than a single shareholder vote. Twitter tried last year to phase out the staggered board terms given that they are frowned upon by the corporate-governance community, but not enough shareholders voted on the measure. The company is attempting to do so again at this year’s annual meeting set for May 25. Only two directors are up for re-election, and it is too late for Mr. Musk to nominate his own.\n",
            "Twitter’s shares have been trading below his offer price since he made the bid April 14, typically a sign that shareholders are skeptical a deal will happen, though they did close up roughly 4% Friday at $48.93, the day after he unveiled financing for the deal. He has indicated that if the current bid fails, he could sell his stake, of more than 9%.\n",
            "The financing included more than $25 billion in debt coming from nearly every global blue-chip investment bank aside from the two advising Twitter. The remainder was $21 billion in equity Mr. Musk would provide himself, likely by selling existing stakes in his other businesses such as Tesla. The speed at which the financing came together and the market selloff in recent days—which makes the all-cash offer look relatively more attractive—likely contributed to Twitter’s greater willingness to entertain Mr. Musk’s proposal.\n",

            "Twitter’s board should engage with Mr. Musk since its stock has “gone nowhere” since the company went public eight years ago, said Jeff Gramm, a portfolio manager with Bandera Partners LLC, a New York hedge fund with about $385 million under management. The firm last bought Twitter shares in February and owns about 950,000 overall, which accounts for about 11% of its portfolio.\n",
            "Mr. Gramm said Twitter’s board can’t walk away from Mr. Musk’s offer without providing an alternative that gives real value to shareholders. “I’m not sure what that can be at this stage besides finding a higher bid,” he said.\n",

            "“The woke mind virus has made Netflix unwatchable,” said Elon Musk recently in a tweet in reply to an article about Netflix’s poor show in the first three months of 2022, where it recorded a loss of 200,000 subscribers.\n",
            "To be fair to Netflix, its decision to exit Russia inflicted a loss of 700,000 subscribers which means that the streaming service actually gained 500,000 subscribers outside of Russia in the first quarter of 2022. However, that does not mean that Netflix is not in trouble. It had earlier told shareholders that it would be adding 2.5 million subscribers in the first quarter but now it expects to lose 2 million subscribers in the second quarter. As a result, its shares are plummeting and investors are pulling out.\n",
            "Netflix’s decision to quit Russia aside, its decision to hike prices and curb password sharing is bound to drive more users to dump the streaming service. Netflix is also reeling under billions of dollars in debt and struggling to compete with a wide range of streaming platforms— Amazon Prime and Disney+ being the toughest competitors. Add to that some of the repulsive ‘woke’ content which further sours the company’s name.\n",
            "Advertisement\n",
            "When users are done streaming shows like Squid Game, Ozark and Stranger Things, they are likely to step out of the user base until the next big season or show arrives. Netflix’s many other shows may tick all the diversity-related checkboxes but are bogged down by their own mediocrity. Filmmakers may believe that being a woke ally may prove to be the saving grace in case the original story and production flop. But getting away with bad content by pandering to one lobby has not been all that easy, if not counterproductive. There are also many shows that have raised eyebrows for gender-swapped and race-swapped characters in historical dramas always pertaining to the white man’s culture and history. It is a shallow idea based on poor identity politics that has not sat well with many on both sides of the ideological divide.\n",

Not all elements of “wokeism” were inculcated by the left— regime change wars and anti-establishment beliefs were brushed under the carpet for the left parties have an equal interest, if not more, in wars.\n",
            "For example, Netflix’s Bridgerton, a period drama set in the early 19th century Britain, exudes a refreshing level of colour blindness, with non-white faces sauntering around in the background and some playing important roles. But soon the extremely rosy picture of an inclusive British society of the 1800s turns into a tone-deaf, nagging mix of historical inaccuracy, condescension and whitewashing of the crimes that sustained such a world for the white British woman to gossip away in beautiful dresses without a care for the world or the blood on their wealth. Fictional fantasies placed in historical periods are free to play with certain soft aspects such as interpersonal and romantic relationships, but should they really whitewash certain hard aspects of history itself? Why sell an alternative story and confuse young people of colour about the otherwise undeniable facts of history? Filmmakers should instead try telling legitimate stories about Black people and other people of colour while also respecting their culture and history. But such is the woke virus that foisting pretty dresses and cups of tea on non-white actors is expected to win favour with the politically charged audience.\n",

            "In India also, Netflix has had a “frustrating” run as expressed by co-CEO Reed Hastings over its lack of success. While Bollywood is already on a decline for often churning big-budget but substance-free films, many of Netflix’s originals are rife with content that enraged large sections of the Indian audience. While Indians kept an open mind with the streaming platform since it started in 2016, Netflix started off with a clear axe to grind with the larger Hindu community often hurting the sensitivities of Hindus by denigrating Hindu Gods. Finally, a show called “Leila” took Hinduphobia to extremes by being all about a dystopian society enforced by Hindus. The Islamo-leftist element of modern-day wokeism of the West was clear in Netflix’s agenda on India. This was how Netflix stamped itself as a disrespectful, Hinduphobic company often facing boycott calls in India. Things have cooled down, and it might even be trying to mend its ways, but the damage to Netflix and its subscriber growth has been done, especially in a cut-throat Indian market where cheaper alternatives began to emerge.\n",
            "Advertisement\n",
            "A decade ago, being woke in the West meant being aware of racial oppression and inequality. It meant remembering and cherishing the history of native Americans. It also meant being anti-establishment and acutely aware of the wars waged by belligerent powers including the home country. This meant questioning the USA’s various regime change wars or Britain’s history of colonialism. Being woke meant discussing pedophilia and sexual harassment scandals in politics, Hollywood and the church. For the woke back in the day, the politicians in power were all the same and this is one of the reasons why Hillary Clinton lost to Trump- because a section of voters was disillusioned with the establishment and started talking about “not voting\" or “choosing the lesser of the two evils\". The woke conversations on the internet were a threat to the Democrats.\n",
            "Advertisement\n",
            "However, things went berserk. The word “Woke” was co-opted by the left-wing parties and their brand of politics and shunned by the right. Not all elements of “wokeism” were inculcated by the left— regime change wars and anti-establishment beliefs were brushed under the carpet for the left parties have an equal interest, if not more, in wars. This corrupted version of Wokeism is meant to protect the same ideas and the people that the woke were disillusioned with a decade ago when Obama, with his Nobel Peace Prize, went on to bombard Libya, Syria and Afghanistan and became the best friend of the USA’s war machine. Today’s set of woke individuals would never talk about this. In other words, most of the people who identify as “woke\" today could not be further from the truth.\n",
            "The race politics, the open borders, the alarmist politics of climate change, the radical science-free activism around gender and more such gems of the Western left are all meant to create a polarising divide, creating a society where loud diktats trump debates. Disagreeing even minutely could run one out of followers, friends and even a job. It is in the interest of such politicians and activists to suppress debates and divide classrooms, colleges, workplaces and every other aspect of society. Clearly no fan of Big Tech censorship and cancel culture, perhaps this is what Elon Musk is talking about when he derides the ‘woke mind virus’.\n",

            "Twitter had been expected to rebuff the offer, which Mr. Musk made earlier this month without saying how he would pay for it. But after he disclosed last week that he now has $46.5 billion in financing, Twitter is taking a fresh look at the offer and is more likely than before to seek to negotiate, people familiar with the matter said. The situation is fast-moving and it is still far from guaranteed Twitter will do so.\n",
            "Twitter is still working on an all-important estimate of its own value, which would need to come in close to Mr. Musk’s offer, and it could also insist on sweeteners such as Mr. Musk agreeing to cover breakup protections should the deal fall apart, some of the people said.\n",

            "Twitter is expected to weigh in on the bid when it reports first-quarter earnings Thursday, if not sooner, the people said. Twitter’s response won’t necessarily be black-and-white, and could leave the door open for inviting other bidders or negotiating with Mr. Musk on terms other than price. Mr. Musk reiterated to Twitter’s chairman Bret Taylor in recent days that he won’t budge from his offer of $54.20-a-share, the people said.\n",

            "The potential turnabout on Twitter’s part comes after Mr. Musk met privately Friday with several shareholders of the company to extol the virtues of his proposal while repeating that the board has a “yes-or-no” decision to make, according to people familiar with the matter. He also pledged to solve the free-speech issues he sees as plaguing the platform and the country more broadly, whether his bid succeeds or not, they said.\n",
            "The Tesla Inc. TSLA -0.37% chief executive made his pitch to select shareholders in a series of video calls, with a focus on actively managed funds, the people said, in hopes that they could sway the company’s decision.\n",
            "Mr. Musk said he sees no way Twitter management can get the stock to his offer price on its own, given the issues in the business and a persistent inability to correct them. It couldn’t be learned if he detailed specific steps he would take, though he has tweeted about wanting to reduce the platform’s reliance on advertising, as well as to make simpler changes such as allowing longer tweets.\n",
            "Mr. Musk already has some shareholders rallying behind him following the meetings. Lauri Brunner, who manages Thrivent Asset Management LLC’s large-cap growth fund, sees Mr. Musk as a skilled operator. “He has an established track record at Tesla,” she said. “He is the catalyst to deliver strong operating performance at Twitter.” Minneapolis-based Thrivent has a roughly 0.4% stake in Twitter worth $160 million and is also a Tesla shareholder.\n",
            "Mr. Musk already has said he is considering taking his bid directly to shareholders by launching a tender offer. Even if he was to get significant shareholder support in a tender offer—which is far from guaranteed—he would still need a way around the company’s poison pill, a legal maneuver it employed that effectively blocks him from building his stake to 15% or more.\n",

            "One oft-employed tactic to push a bid, seeking to gain control of the target’s board, is out of reach for now. Twitter’s directors have staggered terms, meaning a dissident shareholder would need multiple years to gain control rather than a single shareholder vote. Twitter tried last year to phase out the staggered board terms given that they are frowned upon by the corporate-governance community, but not enough shareholders voted on the measure. The company is attempting to do so again at this year’s annual meeting set for May 25. Only two directors are up for re-election, and it is too late for Mr. Musk to nominate his own.\n",
            "Twitter’s shares have been trading below his offer price since he made the bid April 14, typically a sign that shareholders are skeptical a deal will happen, though they did close up roughly 4% Friday at $48.93, the day after he unveiled financing for the deal. He has indicated that if the current bid fails, he could sell his stake, of more than 9%.\n",
            "The financing included more than $25 billion in debt coming from nearly every global blue-chip investment bank aside from the two advising Twitter. The remainder was $21 billion in equity Mr. Musk would provide himself, likely by selling existing stakes in his other businesses such as Tesla. The speed at which the financing came together and the market selloff in recent days—which makes the all-cash offer look relatively more attractive—likely contributed to Twitter’s greater willingness to entertain Mr. Musk’s proposal.\n",

            " Photo: Getty Images\n",
            "Looking back on the paths of accomplished entrepreneurs and it's easy to think you could have predicted their success: Steve Jobs. Jeff Bezos. Sara Blakely. With the benefit of hindsight, the Apple, Amazon, and Spanx outcomes seemed inevitable. \n",
            "Accurately predicting success at the beginning of an entrepreneurial journey is a whole lot harder.\n",
            "Prime example? Charlie Munger and Tesla.\n",
            "If you aren't familiar, Munger is Warren Buffett's longtime business partner and the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway. For those who like to keep score, Munger is currently worth approximately $2.6 billion.\n",
            "So yeah, he knows a little something about picking winners.\n",
            "But he's not always right. According to Elon Musk, in 2009, Munger spent considerable time telling a table full of people -- including Musk -- all the ways Tesla would fail.\n",
            "To be fair, Munger was right, at least early on. After Tesla's IPO at $17 per share, the stock price quickly dipped and for the next three years traded for less than $10 per share. \n",
            "Today, though? Tesla stock closed trading last week at $985 per share -- which means the $1,700 you might have spent to purchase 100 shares at the IPO price, taking into account the 2020 5 for 1 split, would now be worth nearly $500,000. \n",
            "A misjudgment Munger admits, if in a backhanded-compliment kind of way. \n",
            "According to Munger, Musk is:\n",
            "Very able, but he thinks he's even more able than he is and that's helped him. Never underestimate the man who overestimates himself ... Some of the extreme successes are going to come from people who try very extreme things because they're overconfident. And when they succeed, well, there you get Elon Musk.\n",
            "Which leads us to two things.\n",
            "Outsize Returns Don't Just Involve Money\n",
            "By launching Tesla, Musk clearly hoped to seize a financial opportunity. Finding and extracting hydrocarbons grows increasingly expensive. Hybrid cars, electric cars -- they're the future.\n",
            "And the automobile market is a huge market.\n",
            "But Musk also clearly believes in finding ways to reduce the need for non-renewable resources by cheaply and efficiently tapping and using renewable resources. \n",
            "To Musk, the potential return, both financial and environmental, outweighed all the negatives -- all the reasons Tesla would probably die -- he knew all too well before Munger pointed them out. \n",
            "Musk felt the potential returns were so large that the risk of failing on such a grand scale was worth it. (In fact, early on, he gave Tesla a 10 percent chance of surviving.)\n",
            "Munger? He felt Musk was overconfident.\n",
            "Maybe even irrational. \n",
            "Which is point number two.\n",
            "When Belief Is Rational and Irrational\n",
            "Success starts with belief. Belief that you are smart enough. Dedicated enough. Adaptable enough. Willing to work hard, overcome challenges, persevere in the face of adversity.\n",
            "And be willing to see feedback from other people as information: Information you can use to make the right decisions for you. Musk listened to Munger, he agreed with his analysis. He didn't think Munger was wrong.\n",
            "But he still pushed ahead. \n",
            "Musk knew batteries were too heavy and delivered insufficient life; he decided he could design lighter, longer-lasting ones. He knew building an automobile company -- as capital intensive a business as you can start -- would be incredibly difficult. He knew gaining widespread consumer adoption, especially early on, would be extremely difficult. He knew the leading edge is often the bleeding edge.\n",
            "He was both rational and irrational. He knew the data, the challenges, the realities -- and believed he could build a team capable of changing those realities.\n",
            "Listen to the naysayers. They might provide information you didn't have. They might uncover challenges you didn't predict.\n",
            "And then decide if you believe in yourself.\n",
            "Especially when success, in whatever way you choose to define success, is worth what others might consider an unacceptable risk.\n",
            "Because Munger was right about this: You should never underestimate people who overestimate themselves.\n",
            "Especially when that person is you.\n",

            "BY CHRISTINE LAGORIO-CHAFKIN, SENIOR WRITER, INC.\n",
            "@LAGORIO\n",
            "Nikki Huganir (left) and Erica Blumenthal, co-founders of Yes Way Rosé.\n",
            "When Erica Blumenthal and Nikki Huganir started their company, Yes Way Rosé, in 2013, they didn't have a product, or even any relevant experience in the food or beverage industry. They had only an idea for a brand they'd create, products they hoped to launch, and the dream of eventually rolling out their own line of French rosé wines in the United States.\n",
            "They took it slow, on purpose. They created a logo, and posted it on Instagram. It got some likes, and praise from friends. Then the meme accounts came for it. \"We would see the logo being reshared by other people. We weren't given credit or ownership,\" Blumenthal says. \"It was this thing on the internet that seemed like property of the internet, not property of these entrepreneurs who were creating a brand.\"\n",
            "It would be months before they'd debut their first product--a simple tote bag with the company logo on it--and five years before their first wine vintage debuted. The founders knew they needed to protect the logo that would be on those and any future products.\n",
            "A lawyer friend helped them take the first step: Hiring an intellectual property and trademark attorney and filing for a trademark for the use of the phrase \"Yes Way Rosé\" on products including T-shirts, beach towels, phone cases, and, of course, wine.\n",
            "Since that time, they've retained the lawyer, which Blumenthal says is one of the company's most significant, but worthwhile, expenses: \"You want to protect your intellectual property at all costs.\"\n",
            "Brand enforcement has continued to be a priority, especially since the company launched its first wine vintage in 2018 in Target stores across the United States. When a product uses their logo, they send a standard cease-and-desist letter. If it's from a very small business, say, an Etsy shop, or seems like an innocent mistake, they send a less formal letter, a strategy that has also been effective.\n",
            "One thing that no longer keeps Blumenthal up at night is the meme accounts. \"I definitely obsessed about it for a long time, but we've learned to embrace it, as a brand,\" she says. \"You learn to pick your battles.\"\n",
            "Her advice for founders with a logo-product: \"Think about trademarking early, while you're in the development stages, before putting your product in stores, or setting up direct-to-consumer sales,\" she says. \"And definitely before sharing it with the internet.\"\n",

            "While protest movements have risen and fallen, and political parties spend untold resources promoting their agendas, Twitter has long struggled to remove or at least contain hate speech, incitement to violence and trolling operations on its platform.\n",
            "What would happen in countries vulnerable to social unrest and communal violence if the company threw its content rules out the window and embraced an absolute commitment to free speech?\n",
            "Elon Musk wants to find out. In his recent bid to buy the company, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO wrote of his belief in Twitter’s “potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe.” Musk pledged to “unlock” that potential, implying that he would ditch the company’s content rules and simply let the tweets flow.\n",
            "In case you missed it: Musk bought 9% of shares in the company in mid-March, a figure that only became public last week, prompting Twitter’s leadership to offer him a seat on its board of directors. Musk entertained the offer, but then had a second thought: Why not just buy the whole company? The board opted to deploy a so-called “poison pill” strategy, effectively preventing a Musk takeover.\n",
            "But there was still time to wonder what might happen if the world’s wealthiest person got his way. Academic experts cautioned that an absolute free speech policy would turn the platform into a cesspool of hate speech, spam, and porn. Veteran tech critics pointed out that Musk’s ideas about content moderation were popular in the earlier days of the internet, and that time has proven that they really don’t work at scale. Across the political spectrum in the U.S., pundits speculated on whether this would pave the way for Donald Trump to return to the platform.\n",
            "What would it mean for the majority of Twitter users, who live outside the U.S.?\n",
            "“That just doesn’t work in a country like India,” said Nikhil Pahwa, a tech expert and founder of Medianama, an India-focused tech policy publication based in New Delhi. India is Twitter’s third-largest market after the U.S. and Japan.\n",
            "“We have real world consequences from the kind of speech that Twitter enables. Our political parties are really, really adept at understanding how the algorithms work, how to create trends, how to make something shareable,” Pahwa said. “What they excel at is essentially fueling hate.”\n",

A female researcher I spoke with, who studies gender-based harassment online, declined to be quoted for this story, citing concern that she would be attacked as a result.\n",

It took several months, and a police visit to Twitter’s local offices, before the company complied.\n",
            "Twitter has faced similar kinds of pressure in sub-Saharan Africa, where it plays a significant role in national politics in the region’s largest markets, Nigeria and Ethiopia.\n",
            "In Nigeria, Twitter in 2020 became the digital ground zero for #EndSARS, a social movement protesting police brutality that played out both online and in cities across the country.\n",
            "“Twitter created a special emoji for the EndSARS protest, and also verified some major handles that promoted the protests. [Former CEO Jack Dorsey] himself raised some money for them via Bitcoin,” said Nwachukwu Egbunike, a media and communications scholar at Pan-Atlantic University in Lagos. \n",
            "“The feeling around government quarters is that Twitter really sided with protesters,” he said.\n",
            "Less than a year later, the government banned Twitter altogether, after moderators took down a tweet posted by President Muhammadu Buhari that contained a veiled threat against Igbos, one of the country’s largest ethnic groups.\n",
            "This went on for seven months. When they lifted the ban, officials announced that they had reached an agreement with Twitter, under which the company would “act with a respectful acknowledgement of Nigerian laws and the national culture and history,” and alluded to a code of conduct meant to govern the relationship. This document has not been made public.\n",
            "“One has the impression that Twitter gave in or compromised Nigerian digital rights in order to get unbanned,” said Egbunike. “If this agreement is true, and the Nigerian government has the power to pull down tweets, where does that leave Nigerians?” he asked.\n",
            "Egbunike’s question would be a good one for Elon Musk. The governments of both Nigeria and India have demonstrated that if companies like Twitter want to stay accessible in their countries, they need to be prepared to comply with censorship demands and the whims of whichever party is in power. \n",
            "In theory, regular people can still say whatever they like online, but between rules like these and political parties’ online influence operations and troll armies, the costs of doing so can be pretty high. \n",
            "Victims of violence stoked on the platforms pay the highest price of all. Endalk Chala, a communications professor at Hamline University and former blogger, described the role Twitter has come to play in Ethiopia’s ongoing civil conflict. Twitter has made some efforts to curb problematic speech coming from pro-government voices, Chala explained, but different ethnic groups continue to promote violence and hate on the platform.\n",
            "“On Twitter, if a person from one ethnolinguistic group makes fun of a person from another, and that speech is available for people who feel attacked and derided, [members of the target group] will be harmed,” said Chala. “People are dying every day now for things like this,” he said.\n",
            "“There is really bad content, in English, Amharic and in other Ethiopian languages. The content moderation on Twitter doesn’t work really well,” he said.\n",
            "What if, as Musk advocates, the company simply stopped trying to moderate speech in Ethiopia?\n",
            "“I am all for free speech,” Chala said. “But if it’s this messy now, you can’t imagine what would happen without it.”\n",

            "The Tesla electric vehicle and SpaceX rocket company developer is bankrolling a $100 million XPRIZE Carbon Removal competition for the most promising ways to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide by grabbing the gas right out of the air.\n",
            "The 15 early-phase \"milestone round\" winners were announced Friday and each will get $1 million, a welcome boost for the teams to carry on with and scale up their work.\n",
            "\"What we've said is you haven't given us a million bucks; what you've done is catalyzed investment in this technology,\" said Mike Kelland, CEO of Planetary Technologies, a milestone winner that seeks to increase the ocean's ability to absorb carbon dioxide by controlling the rising acidity of seawater.\n",
            "FILE - Tesla CEO Elon Musk, left, shakes hands with XPRIZE founder and Executive Chairman Peter Diamandis during an XPRIZE presentation event in Los Angeles, May 15, 2019.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File)\n",
            "AP\n",
            "The milestone winners aren't necessarily ahead or favored for the $80 million in final prize money that will be awarded in three years. Until Dec. 1, 2023, anyone can still jump in the contest, which was announced a year ago, and potentially get a share of that money.\n",
            "The final winning team or teams will need to show they can remove 1,100 tons (1,000 metric tons) of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year, show how much it would cost to remove up to 1.1 million tons (1 million metric tons) per year and show a path to removing billions of tons of carbon dioxide per year.\n",
            "A third party - neither the participants nor XPRIZE - will independently validate the work submitted for the grand prize to be announced on April 20, 2025.\n",
            "XPRIZE announced $5 million in carbon removal project awards to university student teams last fall. The milestone winners announced Friday propose a variety of ways to remove carbon dioxide through artificial means and by helping nature do much of the work herself.\n",
            "Planetary Technologies isn't looking up into the sky but down in the ocean to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide. The Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada-based company proposes to use antacids produced from the leftovers of metal mining to make the ocean more able to absorb the greenhouse gas.\n",
            "\"If we kind of ignore the ocean - say we're trying to do this on land, we're trying to store it in the ground - we're just not going to make it,\" Kelland said. \"That's sort of the opinion of a lot of these scientists working in this field.\"\n",
            "Durham, North Carolina-based 8 Rivers Capital, sees ocean chemistry as a model to replicate. The winning company seeks to trap atmospheric carbon dioxide in calcium carbonate crystals, similar to how the gas dissolved in the ocean helps form seashells and limestone.\n",
            "Company spokesperson Adam Goff described the process as \"poetic\" in a way.\n",
            "\"The calcium cycle is how the earth regulates its CO2 over millions of years. We're sort of speeding up that natural cycle,\" Goff said.\n",
            "Global Algae, based in Santee, California, won with a plan to cultivate algae to help restore rain forests, which capture huge volumes of carbon dioxide. Algae can be a more efficient and more profitable alternative to the cattle ranching and soy and palm oil crops currently on cleared rain forest land, said Mark Hazlebeck, a principal of the family-owned company.\n",
            "\"We're actually creating more oil and protein while we're reforesting at the same time,\" Hazlebeck said.\n",
            "The prize announcement comes as the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns in ever-starker terms of the threat of rising global temperatures, including worsening heat, fires, storms and droughts.\n",
            "\"We still need more - more and deeper emissions cuts, and more reliable, validated carbon removal solutions. That's why we launched this prize,\" said Marcius Extavour, chief scientist and vice president of climate and environment at XPRIZE.\n",
            "XPRIZE is a technology promotion organization known in part for a contest that encouraged development of a privately funded, reusable spacecraft in 2004. Last year, two teams that showed they could profitably trap carbon dioxide from smokestacks in concrete split a $15 million XPRIZE award.\n",
            "\"Even if we stopped CO2 production, that's probably still not enough,\" XPRIZE founder and executive chairman Peter Diamandis said in a 2021 chat with Musk posted on the XPRIZE website. \"We do need mechanisms for extraction of CO2 from the atmosphere and the oceans that don't exist right now.\"\n",
            "The risk of climate disaster could become \"dire\" if the trend of higher greenhouse gas concentrations continues alongside human population growth and industrialization, Musk replied.\n",
            "\"It's probably an unwise experiment to run,\" Musk said. \"Right now, we've only got one planet. Even if 0.1% chance of disaster, why run that risk? It's crazy.\"\n",

            "Elon Musk has repeatedly pumped dog coins on Twitter.\n",
            "A feature in the new issue of Businessweek declares Jack Dorsey \"Bitcoin's spiritual leader.\"\n",
            "Maybe so, but on Crypto Twitter, they pray to Elon Musk. The Tesla CEO has 82 million followers to Twitter co-founder @Jack's 6 million, and has gleefully pumped Dogecoin again and again and again, as well as Bitcoin before he decided its environmental impact was a bad look for green-friendly Tesla. (Even after his 180-turn on Bitcoin, Musk's Tesla is partnering with Dorsey's Block to power a Bitcoin mining facility in Texas.)\n",
            "Now Musk has offered to buy Twitter for $43 billion, holding the tech, financial, and crypto news cycles all in his thrall. Twitter's board will likely reject the offer regardless of the financials and has already poison-pilled Musk to shut him out for longer. New Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal sounds terrified.\n",
            "But the citizens of Crypto Twitter should be cheering Musk on—not because of his claims that this is all about free speech, but because a Musk takeover would actually mean Twitter adopting the crypto tools it has touted halfheartedly.\n",
            "Every crypto-related feature Twitter has turned on has fizzled, either by design or due to mismanagement. Twitter rolled out crypto tipping last September, but you can still only tip in Bitcoin; it took a talented hacker to figure out how to add Ethereum to the tip jar. Twitter added verified NFT profile pictures in January, but only for Twitter Blue subscribers ($3 per month), only on iPhone, and only for Ethereum NFTs listed on OpenSea.\n",
            "Crypto tools don't make any sense if they're approached from a maximalist attitude, limited to just the largest coin or largest NFT market. The point of crypto is openness and decentralization. (Yes, yes, as many point out, Twitter is a centralized company, which is part of the problem—and a single billionaire buying it would only make it less democratic.) Tools like sending someone crypto instantly and verifying your ownership of an NFT via blockchain could help crypto go mainstream by bringing in normies—but only if they're open to a wide range of cryptocurrencies, blockchains, and NFT sources.\n",

            "That's what Musk wants to do. At a TED event on Thursday, he specifically listed opening up Twitter's source-code on GitHub and enabling Dogecoin for payments for Twitter Blue among his priorities.\n",
            "Crypto luminaries are on board. FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried tweeted, \"Because it would all be on-chain, it would be trivial to integrate\" better crypto tipping, NFT avatars, and \"sure, why not DOGE.\" Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev thinks Dogecoin can become \"the future currency of the internet.\" Marc Andreessen supports Musk's buyout. Dogecoin co-founder Billy Markus is cheering it on (though interestingly, the other Dogecoin co-founder, Jackson Palmer, is not).\n",
            "Musk won't get Twitter, but he has clearly reignited a bidding process for the platform, which has not worked as a public company. Disney was ready to buy in 2016, but the day after its board approved the deal, Bob Iger changed his mind because \"there were brand-related issues that gnawed at me\" and called Dorsey to call it off. Any other big tech brand will have the same brand issues, so the buyer will have to be an individual billionaire or a private equity group like Silver Lake.\n",

            "Elon Musk said he's \"moving on\" from \"making fun\" of Bill Gates after leaked texts revealed the Microsoft founder shorted Tesla.\n",
            "After Musk initially shared a vague tweet on Sunday that led many to speculate he may be halting recent attempts to buy out Twitter, the billionaire Tesla CEO followed up to clarify the post was in reference to Gates. On Friday, Musk confirmed the veracity of leaked texts between the two tech moguls in which Musk turned down a request from Gates to discuss a possible philanthropic venture because of his \"massive short position against Tesla.\" \n",
            "—Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 24, 2022\n",
            " \"Sorry, but I cannot take your philanthropy on climate change seriously when you have a massive short position against Tesla, the company doing the most to solve climate change,\" Musk wrote in a text to Gates, according to the screenshots. \n",
            "The text came after Musk asked if Gates still had \"a half billion dollar short position against Tesla.\" A short position usually involves betting a stock's value will fall by selling a borrowed stock with the intention of buying it back later at a lower price. \n",
            "\"Sorry to say I haven't closed it out,\" Gates replied, according to the screenshots. \"I would like to discuss philanthropy possibilities.\"\n",
            "Musk subsequently posted a meme on Friday that showed a photo of Gates juxtaposed next to an image of a pregnant man emoji, seemingly mocking his weight. \n",
            "Musk's clarification about his initial tweet came after several users asked if it meant he was backing off from his attempt to purchase Twitter. The move has caused an uproar in which experts have predicted Musk may move forward with a hostile takeover of the social platform. \n",
            "On Thursday, Musk confirmed he secured funding to purchase Twitter from banks and other entities, stating in a regulatory filing on Thursday that he had committed \"to provide an aggregate of approximately $46.5 billion\"  to buy the company. \n",
            "The filing was a response to Twitter's \"poison pill\" defense to block Musk's bid — a tactic also known as a shareholders' rights plan, which essentially dilutes shares of a company by increasing the total number of shares on the market in an effort to avoid being acquired against their will. \n",
            "The shareholders' rights plan, filed by Twitter in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Monday, would be activated if any \"entity, person, or group\" obtained more than 15% of Twitter's shares. Musk currently owns 9.1% of the company's stock.\n",
            "Confirming the funding, however, puts Musk in a position to use a traditional hostile takeover approach called a tender offer in which Musk can offer shareholders cash for their stock at a higher price than it's valued on the market. His next move at this point remains to be seen. \n",
            "Earlier this month, Musk was appointed to Twitter's board of directors after announcing his large stake in the company, a position he at first accepted before turning it down. Just days later, he made a bid to buy the social media company. \n",

            "4 min read . Updated: 25 Apr 2022, 12:57 AM IST\n",
            "Manu Joseph\n",
            "It probably makes life meaningful, as it does for most people, but on a significantly grander scale\n",
            "India’s billionaires are widely quoted, but we do not know their voice. On most matters, we don’t know what they think. When they speak, they are mostly uninteresting. They are not even boring in distinct ways. Meanwhile, some American billionaires have become more popular and influential than most politicians, writers, artists and holy men. And they have done this without paying millions to promote themselves. This is because they can say things and not be ruined in return. Elon Musk, one of the richest men ever to have lived, has used this freedom on Twitter to offer a new form of entertainment. What he does answers this question: What happens when a person has no oppressors? Yet, Musk is interesting not because a person who cannot be oppressed can say anything. That is too rudimentary; in fact, that is something even self-absorbed people with no children can apparently do. What makes Musk so fascinating may have a much more complex answer: When you have no oppressors, you would set out to find them.\n",
            "Almost everyone in this world feels oppressed. They don’t like it, but it does not mean they don’t need it. Without a sense of being oppressed, people are lost. This torment satisfies the soul. Too much of it will break us, but its disappearance could send us afloat in a frictionless void.\n",
            "Most of us do not seek oppression because we do not have to. It is always bearing down on us. It comes from familiar places.\n",
            "When scholars speak of oppression, they make it seem as though it is something grand, like politics or history or culture, and that everyone is oppressed by the same massive force. It’s not true. They’re talking about what oppresses them, not you. We are oppressed by the familiar just a notch above us. People are seldom harmed by things that are much grander than them. You are more likely to be oppressed by a mere boss or family or a street thug than, say, an ideology. And your househelp is probably more oppressed by her husband or your security guard or you than by billionaires. Despots see their oppressor in the US. American leaders see their oppressor in half the population of America, what they call “polarisation\". In this way, many things that Elon Musk does could be part of a quest for an oppressor, a despicable force whose existence can make life more meaningful.\n",

            "hatever becomes of Tesla chief executive Elon Musk’s tentative moves to buy Twitter, the drama surrounding his bid tells us something about the issues facing the social media giant—and maybe about many journalists’ dysfunctional relationship with it.\n",
            "For one thing, conservative complaints of Twitter censorship are typically met with the progressive response that the social media site is not a true “public town square” with equal access, but a private company that can write and enforce its own rules and enforce them as they please, the way one would in one’s living room. True enough, from a legal standpoint. And yet many liberals and progressives’ vocal dismay at Musk’s offer to buy Twitter confirms that they do, in fact, see the company as playing an immensely important public role in determining the scope of mainstream conversation.\n",
            "ADVERTISEMENT\n",
            "Robert Reich, former U.S. secretary of labor and professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley, lamented that Musk was seeking to “control one of the most important ways the public now receives news” and “be the wizard behind the curtain” deciding what gets projected onto the world’s computer screens. Max Boot, a one-time conservative pundit now aligned with Democrats as a result of his opposition to Donald Trump, even suggested on Twitter that there was cause to worry about the future of democracy itself if Musk were to acquire the platform.\n",

            "Greg Lukianoff\n",
            "If Twitter has that kind of importance, then it is less a living room than the proverbial “town square” (as Musk has recently asserted in a TED talk). This doesn’t mean, of course, that Twitter management should be legally bound by First Amendment speech protections. It does mean that people concerned about preserving a truly liberal social and political culture have good reasons to push back if Twitter’s policies curb legitimate speech or put an ideological thumb on the scale.\n",
            "Do they? I have no doubt that a lot of right-wing complaints of oppression on Twitter are whiny grievance politics. In a recent study led by researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for instance, two-thirds of “strong Republican” Twitter users thought it was “anti-conservative” to suspend accounts pushing the QAnon conspiracy theory about global pedophile cabals. The same study found that in the six months after the 2020 election, pro-Trump accounts were roughly five times more likely to get suspended on Twitter than ones supporting Joe Biden—but the tendency of pro-Trump accounts to spread misinformation, rated as such by a politically balanced panel, likely accounted for much of this disparity.\n",
            "And yet the lack of transparency in Twitter’s enforcement of its rules, including bans and tweet removals—and in the functioning of Twitter algorithms that boost certain stories and hashtags and hide others—readily lends itself to claims of bias.\n",
            "One can think that the Hunter Biden laptop story is a nothingburger and still believe that Twitter’s decision to block links to the New York Post story about it in the fall of 2020 was driven less by concern about the integrity of information than by worry that it would be weaponized by the right. It is still unclear whether Twitter at one point suppressed content referring to the “lab leak theory” of COVID-19’s origins. (The Daily Beast asked for clarification from Twitter, but has not yet received a response.)\n",
            "Another contentious area in which bias has been alleged—and not just by conservatives, but by radical feminists—is transgender issues. Users have been banned, suspended and otherwise censored not only for attacking specific transgender women, but for making general statements such as, “All rapists are men. In U.K. law, rape is committed by a person with a penis.” Meanwhile, tweets that appear to call for the violent rape of a mainstream, left-of-center journalist who has been accused of transphobia for writing about the complexities of gender transition for minors are allowed to stay up.\n",
            "This is less about intentional discrimination than about the instinctive progressive biases of many of the top staff at Twitter. Del Harvey, a Twitter veteran who served as the company’s vice president for trust and safety until last October, has been fairly open about her belief that preventing “harm” to “marginalized” users—women, racial minorities, LBGT people, etc.—should take priority. However noble the intent, this is a prescription for nannyism at best (especially since progressive discourse defines “harm” very broadly) and political bias at worst.\n",
            "“...the lack of transparency in Twitter’s enforcement of its rules, including bans and tweet removals—and in the functioning of Twitter algorithms that boost certain stories and hashtags and hide others—readily lends itself to claims of bias.”\n",
            "Advertisement\n",
            "Where does Musk come in? His politics cannot be easily pegged (he has railed against “fascist” COVID-19 lockdowns, but quit Trump’s business councils after the administration withdrew from the Paris climate accord). However, his broad libertarianism and his criticism of Twitter for “de facto bias” has inspired fears that he would turn Twitter into a free-for-all den of neo-Nazis, Holocaust deniers, QAnon fanatics, and anti-vaxxers.\n",
            "In his TED talk, Musk confirmed that he would err on the side of more speech as long as it’s not legally prohibited. Whether that means Musk’s Twitter would allow all constitutionally protected speech (i.e. pretty much everything except for threats and libel) is unclear. However, a couple of his suggestions—making the algorithm Twitter uses to boost and deboost content transparent, and relying on “time-outs” more than permanent bans—seem constructive.\n",

            "Some concerns have to do with Musk’s personal volatility, such as the 2018 incident in which he got into a spat with a British cave explorer working on the rescue of teens trapped in a cave in Thailand and called him “pedo guy.” But presumably, Musk as Twitter CEO would still rely on advisers and staff to run it. And if he did run it erratically, sane users would desert it en masse—which many people might say would be the best thing to happen to our democracy.\n",
            "I wouldn’t go that far. However, I do think one potentially good lesson from the Musk/Twitter saga would be to prompt a rethinking of the extent to which we have made Twitter our “town square”—given that only one in five Americans use it and 10 percent of users provide 80 percent of the content. (Notably, Twitter’s policing of election-fraud and anti-vaxx conspiracy theories has not prevented large segments of the population from embracing them.)\n",
            "Part of Twitter’s outsize importance is that it’s the playpen of choice for media and for political activists. It can be a useful tool for news gathering and discussion, but it can also create a faux consensus increasingly adrift from the real world. Too many journalists are too married to Twitter.\n",

            "PARIS – Emmanuel Macron has secured a comfortable victory against far-right challenger Marine Le Pen in the French presidential election despite widespread political discontent leading to the lowest turnout in more than half a century.\n",
            "The incumbent Macron, of the political party La République en Marche, is on course to win a bitterly fought contest with a vote share of between 57.3% and 58.2%, according to analyses – based on sample votes from about 300 polling stations across the country – produced by several French broadcasters.\n",
            "Despite the fact that final polling averages showed Macron some 10 percentage points ahead of Le Pen, with the gap widening after a tight finish in the first round of the election two weeks ago, the result will be a huge relief for leaders across Europe.\n",
            "Macron, who will continue to lead the European Union’s second-largest economy and lone nuclear power for another five years, is only the third French president to be re-elected during the Fifth Republic, which began in 1958.\n",
            "“This is a clear victory,” said Clément Beaune, the secretary of state for European affairs under Macron. “It’s important, it’s very important, because this was a political combat, a political combat against the far right.”\n",
            "The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, tweeted her “congratulations” to Macron, “[rejoicing] to be able to continue our excellent cooperation. Together, we will move France and Europe forward.”\n",
            "But while the margin of victory is significant, the result represents a tightening of the voting since the pair faced off in 2017, when Macron resoundingly beat his right-wing National Rally party opponent with 66.1% of the vote.\n",
            "Le Pen, who had pledged to hold a referendum on immigration, ban the Muslim headscarf from public places, withdraw from NATO and oppose an embargo on Russian oil and gas, gained the highest-ever vote share for the far right.\n",
            "In the aftermath of the election result, Le Pen appeared to reverse her previous comments about planning to retire and insisted she would “continue my commitment to France and to the French”, adding: “This is not yet over.”\n",
            "Concerns over the potential for high numbers of hesitant voters or those opting to abstain entirely that dominated the last weeks of the election campaign came to fruition. The abstention rate among France’s 48.8 million eligible voters is projected to be 28%, the highest since 1959, in a sign of the public’s unhappiness over the choice of candidates on offer.\n",
            "“The high abstention is very concerning,” says Isabelle Le Breton-Falézan, a lecturer in French political science at the Sorbonne University. “In 2017, Macron was seen as optimistic, a new promise, a disruptor. That’s not the case any more. This represents a rejection of both candidates and not a vote of support for Macron. His legitimacy might be questioned.”\n",

            "Macron, a 44-year-old former Rothschild banker, has been regularly accused by critics of being an arrogant “president of the rich” and his first term saw millions take to the streets to protest under the gilets jaunes, or yellow vests, an anti-establishment movement that came to symbolize those forgotten by his government.\n",
            "Macron’s election strategy positioned himself as a lesser of two evils and drew on the “Republican Front” – an historic coalition of voters who despite political differences traditionally mobilize to prevent a far-right presidency, as was seen in 2002 when Jean-Marie Le Pen, Marine’s father, was beaten by Jacques Chirac.\n",
            "While the French economy has performed impressively through the pandemic, voters have been unhappy with Macron's increasingly right-wing and pro-business agenda, including tax cuts for businesses and the highest earners and policies that critics said targeted Muslims and opened up space for the far right in French politics.\n",
            "“What we’ll have to remember is that Macron has helped mainstream a lot of far right ideas and discourse,” says Aurelien Mondon, an expert in the political mainstreaming of the French far right at Bath University. “He’s made it stronger and legitimized it further. Will he still continue to do so in his second term?”\n",
            "In a televised debate on Wednesday, Macron performed strongly and spoke about links between Le Pen’s far-right party and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Her National Rally party took several loans from Russia in 2014, including a $9.75 million loan from the Kremlin-linked First Czech Russian Bank.\n",
            "But analysts say despite his victory on Sunday Macron faces significant obstacles in obtaining sufficient support in the National Assembly elections in June to be able to govern effectively, and will face a country where only a minority enthusiastically support his liberal internationalist outlook. In the first round of the election, nearly 60% of voters supported candidates of the far right or far left.\n",
            "“It’s going to be a serious challenge,” adds Le Breton-Falézan. “The legislative elections will be very different to the presidential elections and Macron’s party is much more fragile.”\n",
            "The left-wing leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who has emerged as a surprise kingmaker after coming third place in the first round with 21% of the vote, has called on voters to make him prime minister in the legislative elections.\n",
            "“Madame Le Pen has been beaten,” said Mélenchon in reaction to the results. “France has clearly refused to entrust its future to her, and this is very good news for the unity of our people. However, Emmanuel Macron has become the most poorly elected president of the Fifth Republic. His victory is floating in an ocean of abstentions and spoiled ballots.”\n",

            "Twitter drama has never had higher stakes. As the Elon Musk saga continues, the crypto industry is watching closely. [Image via Jeremy Bezanger]\n",
            "There’s never a dull moment on the blockchain. Here’s what you need to know this week:\n",
            "\n",
            "The crypto world is reacting to Elon Musk’s $43 billion bid for Twitter. Themes around Web3 and decentralization have become key to the story.\n",
            "\n",

            "MUSK SEE TV\n",
            "What does Elon Musk’s Twitter takeover bid have to do with crypto?\n",
            "If you’re interested in crypto, you probably pay at least a little attention to Elon Musk’s Twitter account. The memes and musings he’s shared over the years have helped spark market frenzies and sell-offs alike, which is just one reason why his latest move, a bold attempt to take over Twitter, has Crypto Twitter completely spellbound — DOGE (Musk’s favorite memecoin) even spiked 10% after Musk’s stake in Twitter was made public. But why else is the crypto industry following this story so closely? Let’s dive in.\n",
            "The saga started on April 4, when Musk disclosed purchasing 9.2% of Twitter’s stock. Soon after, Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal announced that Musk would be joining Twitter’s board of directors. Then, a few days later, Agrawal announced that Musk wouldn’t be joining, and the Tesla CEO offered to buy the social media company outright for $43 billion and take it private. Last week, the board implemented a “poison pill” provision — designed to make it too expensive for Musk to buy Twitter by granting shareholders the right to buy more Twitter shares at a discount if Musk increased his stake past 15%. \n",
            "Why does Elon even want Twitter? At least according to his own statements, he wants to protect Twitter’s role as the “de facto town square” of the internet by encouraging “free speech” and limiting content moderation. Another change Musk floated was making the Twitter feed algorithm “open-source” — an idea that’s also been endorsed by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey. (Open-source code is also key to the decentralized ethos underpinning many blockchain applications.)\n",
            "The potential for a “decentralized Twitter” inspired some prominent crypto players. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried mused about encrypted on-chain tweets, while Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson offered to help Musk build a decentralized alternative to Twitter. But the prospect also spurred plenty of crypto-community criticism. Dogecoin co-founder Jackson Palmer voiced discomfort with the world’s wealthiest individual launching a hostile takeover of a public company. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who has no issue with Musk owning Twitter, warned that similar hostile takeover bids from other wealthy individuals or groups — like those from “ethically challenged foreign governments” — could “easily go very wrong.” \n",
            "Twitter has already been funding a decentralized social media project called Bluesky, which is building a “decentralized protocol for public conversations” that will allow users to control their relationships with audiences and let developers innovate on top of the protocol without needing permission. Elsewhere, Web3 developers are working on related concepts. A project called Entre, for example, is focused on connecting working professionals. Each user profile is an NFT, with connections documented on the DeSo blockchain.\n",
            "Why it matters... In the days after Musk’s takeover plans emerged, investors were skeptical — in part because it wasn’t clear how the Tesla CEO would finance the purchase. We know this because Twitter’s stock price initially remained stagnant. But by this week, as other potential admirers began eyeing the company, Twitter’s stock price finally spiked — in part, some analysts say, due to enthusiastic retail investors drawn to the drama. And while no one can say what’s going to happen next in this crazy saga, we all know where we'll hear the news: Twitter.\n",

            "As Bitcoin struggles, altcoins aim for the crypto crown\n",
            "Unless you’re a true diamond-hands HODLer, sputtering BTC prices might have inspired you to at least look at alternatives. “Smaller, lesser-known tokens are outperforming Bitcoin,” reported Bloomberg recently, describing the current moment as “altcoin season.” By building upon Bitcoin’s pioneering tech, thousands of new tokens — from buzzy dog-themed memecoins and Ethereum alternatives to a vast list of obscure challengers — have emerged within crypto’s nearly $2 trillion ecosystem. In the last year, many of the top altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin, but what’s been giving them the edge? Let’s take a look.\n",
            "Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market is nearing an all-time low. The biggest cryptocurrency’s “dominance,” to use one popular metric, hovers around 38% of the total crypto market — only a few percent away from its 2018 all-time low.\n",
            "The surging popularity of DeFi, stablecoins, and NFTs have helped propel rival cryptocurrencies that offer smart-contract compatibility. Smart contracts and decentralized apps (or dapps) were first pioneered by Ethereum, which helped the cryptocurrency become the second-biggest by market cap. ETH’s market cap is currently near half of BTC’s, but by some measures it’s actually bigger than BTC: Ethereum regularly processes nearly five times as many daily transactions and saw greater trade volumes on Coinbase for half of 2021. \n",
            "ETH’s recent performance has likely been driven in part by anticipation over a major upcoming upgrade known as “the merge” or ETH2, which will move Ethereum’s network from a mining-based system to a proof-of-stake system that promises to be faster, cheaper, and more energy efficient. But bugs in testing and other issues have caused repeated delays for the transition, with the timeline now pushed out to this fall. \n",
            "In the meantime, a wave of smart-contract compatible ETH rivals has gained momentum — including Solana (SOL), Terra (LUNA), and Avalanche (AVAX), which have outperformed BTC by more than 300%, 700%, and 280% respectively over the last year, compared to ETH’s nearly 90% outperformance. Ethereum remains the leader in NFTs, with nearly $22 billion in sales over the last year, but fast-rising Solana tallied nearly $2 billion, according to CryptoSlam. When it comes to DeFi, the story is similar. Ethereum remains king, with $117 billion “locked” into smart contracts on the platform, but rivals are rapidly growing: Terra has ballooned to over $29 billion, Avalanche past $11 billion, and Solana past $6 billion. \n",
            "Why it matters… Bitcoin remains the king of crypto, but can it keep its crown as the universe of smart-contract powered applications continues to expand? It’s worth noting that Ethereum fans have long predicted a moment nicknamed the “flippening,” when ETH’s market cap would eclipse BTC’s — but it still hasn’t happened. In part, that’s because Ethereum’s quickly emerging rival blockchains have stolen some of its smart-contract momentum. But it’s also likely because Bitcoin’s simpler utility and history as an inflation-resistant, gold-like store of value remains a pretty strong value proposition. After all, actual gold has a market cap north of $10 trillion.\n",

            "It’s one of at least a dozen high-profile cases that Tesla or Musk are involved in years after he posted the infamous “funding secured” tweet, sending shares soaring and inviting the wrath of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n",
            "Now, as Musk ramps up his battle to buy Twitter Inc., the lingering ramifications of his prior use of the social media platform may come back to haunt him.\n",
            "The judge’s decision tips the scales heavily in favor of Tesla investors who are suing Musk and Tesla for as much as $12 billion in trading losses they blame on the go-private tweets. That case is set for a jury trial in January.\n",
            "The decision also poses a threat to Musk’s effort to unleash himself from oversight by the SEC — a quest so personal for the world’s richest person that he became visibly emotional while lambasting the agency during a TED talk in Canada last week.\n",

            "Securities law experts including Columbia Law School professor Jeffrey Gordon say that being ruled a liar after years of insisting his tweets were truthful will make it harder for the voluble billionaire to wriggle out from underneath the “Twitter Sitter” — the moniker for the arrangement with the SEC that a Tesla official pre-approve what Musk says on social media about certain company-related topics, like production.\n",

            "That was before U.S. District Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco issued his ruling, which remains sealed from public view. \n",
            "Musk is trying to appeal the finding, saying in a filing Friday that the judge “parsed the individual phrases of the various tweets and indicated certain other information should have accompanied the tweets, even though the short-form Twitter medium limits the number of characters per tweet.”\n",
            "Musk’s lawyer, Alex Spiro, didn’t respond to a request for comment on the SEC fight, which is ongoing in New York. But his response to Chen’s ruling on April 16 was defiant.\n",
            "“Nothing will ever change the truth, which is that Elon Musk was considering taking Tesla private and could have,” the attorney said. \n",
            "Gordon said the Tesla CEO isn’t helping himself by continuing to defend the tweet.\n",
            "“Musk’s subsequent denialism in the face of Judge Chen’s ruling will further weaken his case against the SEC,” he said.\n",
            "Not all securities experts agreed Chen’s ruling was so potentially damaging. James D. Cox, a professor at Duke Law School, said the SEC faces an uphill fight trying to apply a ruling from a San Francisco lawsuit to a New York case involving different parties. \n",
            "Going forward, the challenge facing the SEC is how to regulate high-profile public figures like Musk with millions of Twitter followers, with these VIPs knowing the potential impact of their statements on capital markets, said Jill E. Fisch, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. \n",

            "In the San Francisco case, Bloomberg Intelligence estimated before Chen issued his ruling that the lawsuit could settle for between $260 million and $380 million.\n",
            "“The price of settlement just went way up,” said Adam C. Pritchard, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School. Chen’s ruling was a “huge win” for shareholders and an appeal of the decision by Musk “might be hard to come by,” he said. \n",
            "Nicholas Porritt, a lawyer representing shareholders, said he expects Chen’s ruling will become public in the next few days. \n",
            "Chen’s decision means that Musk won’t be able to argue to jurors that some key statements in his tweets were true, or that he didn’t act fraudulently when he made them, Porritt said.\n",
            "A pretrial ruling that so thoroughly discredits a defendant in a securities fraud case is “very rare,” Porritt said. “Certainly it has not been obtained in any case of similar size to this one.”\n",

Randy Bishop, who goes by “Trucker Randy,” made the comments on his March 31 radio show, perpetuating the racist argument that the media is controlled by Black Americans who seek to raise issues of voter suppression while somehow suppressing white Americans. “Can’t even watch a college basketball tournament without commercials telling me I have to feel guilty because I think a family should be a white mom, a white dad, and white kids,” he said. “They want us to die and go away. And they’re going to try to do it through politics this year. Well, we have got to be just as smart.” His comments on Black Americans were even starker: “Why are we allowing such a small percentage of our population to control our society? Because they own the media. Because they own the politicians. Because they own the public schools.”\n",

Musk also made a more recent promise of a custom-made robotaxi, without any controls for the driver, despite the fact that FSD remains a Level-2 system and has already been eclipsed by a number of competitors with Level-3 systems, including Honda and Mercedes-Benz.

While cleaning up radioactive debris at the Fukushima nuclear disaster site, robots certainly were used—just not Asimo. So it couldn't even apply its humanoid robot experience to a crucial, real-life situation that called for just such a thing, until years later.\n",

But Boston Dynamics never quite managed to find a useful market for its humanoid robots either, aside from some promising mule-shaped military prototypes. Like others, Boston Dynamics' robots were held back by current battery tech, among other issues, which is why some of its robot prototypes were actually gas-engined, and quite loud as a result.\n",

            "Elon Musk is the boogeyman. Haven’t you heard? Please, don’t even say his name aloud.\n",
            "Last week, Musk offered to buy Twitter for the premium price of $43 billion, ostensibly in an effort to reinstate free speech on the internet. And the progressive Left hates him for it.\n",
            "Politicians, journalists, and college professors have declared Musk the greatest threat to democracy since Donald Trump. One guy likened Musk’s quest for open conversation to the rise of Hitler in Nazi Germany, while Saturday Night Live openly suggested that Musk only wants free speech so that white guys can use the n-word. Whatever that means.\n",
            "Why are they so worried about Musk, an immigrant from South Africa who likes to smoke weed and make sexually explicit jokes? Musk can single-handedly change the future of online interaction. So to the purveyors of groupthink, Musk is dangerous.\n",
            "Right now, Twitter is not a place where curious people of goodwill go to engage in open discourse. It’s a social media schoolyard where self-important hall monitors prevent people from thinking for themselves. Constantly redirecting upstart free thinkers back to the acceptable narrative is tough work, and the power dynamic is delicate.\n",
            "Now Musk threatens to ruin it all.\n",
            "“Twitter has become kind of the de facto town square, so it’s really important that people have both the reality and the perception that they’re able to speak freely…so there’s no sort of behind-the-scenes manipulation, either algorithmically or manually,” Musk said Thursday at “TED2022: A New Era.”\n",
            "The establishment cannot lose control of Twitter to Musk or to anyone else who would pay fealty to the First Amendment. Twitter is too important. It’s the arbiter of what is right and wrong, racist and not racist, factual and “misleading.” The app recently managed to crowd out dissenting voices and reach a kind of censorship utopia where blue-check influencers can normalize any viewpoint and punish any thoughtcrime, including the belief that gender is biologically determined and not a costume that you can wear as you chose.\n",
            "So Musk is more of a threat to the woke movement than any US president has ever been, even Donald Trump. Trump may have brought awareness to the suppression of free thought in the digital space and in the press, but Musk has the ambition and the resources to destroy the gatekeepers who have held free thought hostage.\n",
            "If Musk can access the algorithms that control Twitter, he can expose what makes Twitter such a critical tool to the Left. To wit, it frightens everyone else into silence. \n",
            "Twitter has convinced those who resist the one true opinion that they are bigots in a fringe minority. Of course, that’s not the case. What has happened is that 3 percent of the population creates 90 percent of all tweets. This 3 percent is loud, vicious, and among the most liberal people in the entire country. Most Twitter users are scared of them, and thus have self-censored themselves. A 2020 survey found that 62 percent of Americans are “afraid” to post their honest views online.\n",
            "Because most Twitter users are scared to contradict the narrative, the app no longer has to work so hard to keep dissenting voices quiet. For instance, Twitter didn’t have to silence over half of its users who believe that COVID restrictions are draconian, that we weren’t all born racist, and that only perverts talk to six-year-olds about sex changes. The threat of online character assassination or losing access to their account kept the rabble-rousers contained.\n",
            "Now, Musk is trying to give the silent majority their voices back. \n",
            "And Twitter mobsters aren’t sure how to neutralize Musk. Their usual threats and labels don’t work on him. If there has ever been a truly uncancellable person, Elon Musk is it. He doesn’t have a boss and doesn’t rely on advertisers for a podcast. He owns multiple major corporations and is worth $264.6 billion, the effest of eff you money on the planet.\n",
            "Musk is not like other billionaires such as Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg. He is completely independent. Politicians can’t control Musk through protective provisions in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. He’s not interested in compromising with journalists in exchange for fawning profiles in the New Yorker.\n",
            "With such rabid independence, how can a group intimidate someone like Musk? Who knows. Fortunately, his detractors have no idea how to intimidate him either. Secretly, they probably already know they can’t.\n",
            "Members of the Twitter board will likely put the financial interests of shareholders to the side and reject Musk’s offer out of spite. Board member Saudi Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal has already said that he opposes Musk’s offer. A Saudi Prince can’t give up censorship in the US, no matter how much money Musk offers. \n",
            "But that won’t actually solve the problem of the pro-censorship crowd. “Poison pills” won’t make Musk go away. Musk has never accepted rejection and says he already has a plan B.\n",
            "And that’s what terrifies the thought police most.\n",
            "If he doesn’t join Twitter, Musk can then haunt Twitter board members and trendsetters from the outside. He can buy an online newspaper or a cable news network and allow his reporters to dig into behind-the-scenes stories from Silicon Valley and Washington DC.\n",
            "He could probably grab CNN at a bargain price these days.\n",
            "Musk is a threat to every Democrat politician and member of corporate media who established themselves through Twitter. They’ve called for suppression, taken over major civic institutions, and subverted the truth. And now, the jig may be up.\n",
            "Elon Musk is perhaps the only influencer on earth who doesn’t answer to the censors. And now, the censors fear they will soon have to answer to him.\n",

Elon Musk has been trolling Bill Gates recently over his decision to short Tesla shares, where Musk is the CEO and the largest shareholder.\n",
            "(from making fun of Gates for shorting Tesla while claiming to support climate change action)\n",
            "— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 24, 2022\n",
            "On April 18, billionaire Elon Musk said on Twitter that if he manages to acquire the company, he will slash the company’s board salary to USD 0. Replying to Gary Black of The Future Fund LLC, Musk wrote on Twitter, “Board salary will be $0 if my bid succeeds, so that’s ~$3M/year saved right there.” This came after he reiterated his offer to take over Twitter and take it private. He said the company has a lot of potential, and he could help Twitter in using it better if he can take the company private.\n",
            "It all started when Elon Musk earlier revealed that he had acquired a 9.2% stake in Twitter, with speculations that he may take over the company in near future. After buying the largest stake in the company, Elon Musk was invited to a seat on the board of directors of Twitter Inc., which he had initially accepted but later decided not to join the board. However, Musk made an offer to buy the whole of Twitter in his attempt to make it a private company. He assured that his proposition will reward the shareholders with a handsome price.\n",
            "In an SEC filing regarding the offer, he wrote, “I am offering to buy 100% of Twitter for USD 54.20 per share in case, a 54% premium over the day I began investing in Twitter and a 38% premium over the day before my investment was publicly announced.”\n",
            "However, the Twitter Board decided not to accept the offer and opted for the Poison Pill. Under the strategic move, the rights become exercisable if anyone acquires ownership of 15% or more of Twitter’s stock in a transaction not authorised by the board. The micro-blogging tech company implemented a limited-duration shareholder rights plan to protect itself from billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk’s $43 billion cash takeover offer.\n",
            "Also, hours after Tesla CEO Elon Musk offered to buy 100% shares of Twitter, Saudi Arabian Prince, and billionaire businessman al-Waleed bin Talal refused to sell his stake in Twitter, citing the future growth prospects of Twitter and low share value for turning down the offer of Elon Musk. Now after the fiasco over Elon Musk’s hostile takeover proposition, another cryptic tweet from the world’s richest man has set the ball of speculations rolling.\n",
            "There are nascent assumptions about Musk pulling back his offer to buy Twitter, which is unlikely to happen. However, as highlighted by him in his SEC bid, there are chances, he might even reconsider his share in the company if his offer is not accepted. “If the deal doesn’t work, given that I don’t have confidence in management nor do I believe I can drive the necessary change in the public market. I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder,” the Tesla CEO had said categorically.\n",
            "The ball has always been in Elon Musk’s court over his Twitter propositions. However,  it is to be seen whether the Twitter board and management manage to stop him from completing his hostile takeover of the micro-blogging platform.\n",

            "As the Twitter acquisition saga of Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk rolls on, the richest man in the world dropped a cryptic tweet saying, “Moving On” which has again set the rumor mills abuzz. Social media users are casting aspersions whether Musk will manage to acquire Twitter fully or the Twitter board’s ‘poison pill‘ strategy has forced him to move on from this venture.\n",
            "Moving on …\n",
            "— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 24, 2022\n",
            "While people were busy speculating whether Elon Musk has decided to abort his attempt to take over Twitter, he sent out a clarification a short while later stating that he has decided to move on from mocking Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. Elon Musk has been trolling Bill Gates recently over his decision to short Tesla shares, where Musk is the CEO and the largest shareholder.\n",
            "(from making fun of Gates for shorting Tesla while claiming to support climate change action)\n",
            "— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 24, 2022\n",
            "On April 18, billionaire Elon Musk said on Twitter that if he manages to acquire the company, he will slash the company’s board salary to USD 0. Replying to Gary Black of The Future Fund LLC, Musk wrote on Twitter, “Board salary will be $0 if my bid succeeds, so that’s ~$3M/year saved right there.” This came after he reiterated his offer to take over Twitter and take it private. He said the company has a lot of potential, and he could help Twitter in using it better if he can take the company private.\n",
            "It all started when Elon Musk earlier revealed that he had acquired a 9.2% stake in Twitter, with speculations that he may take over the company in near future. After buying the largest stake in the company, Elon Musk was invited to a seat on the board of directors of Twitter Inc., which he had initially accepted but later decided not to join the board. However, Musk made an offer to buy the whole of Twitter in his attempt to make it a private company. He assured that his proposition will reward the shareholders with a handsome price.\n",
            "In an SEC filing regarding the offer, he wrote, “I am offering to buy 100% of Twitter for USD 54.20 per share in case, a 54% premium over the day I began investing in Twitter and a 38% premium over the day before my investment was publicly announced.”\n",
            "However, the Twitter Board decided not to accept the offer and opted for the Poison Pill. Under the strategic move, the rights become exercisable if anyone acquires ownership of 15% or more of Twitter’s stock in a transaction not authorised by the board. The micro-blogging tech company implemented a limited-duration shareholder rights plan to protect itself from billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk’s $43 billion cash takeover offer.\n",
            "Also, hours after Tesla CEO Elon Musk offered to buy 100% shares of Twitter, Saudi Arabian Prince, and billionaire businessman al-Waleed bin Talal refused to sell his stake in Twitter, citing the future growth prospects of Twitter and low share value for turning down the offer of Elon Musk. Now after the fiasco over Elon Musk’s hostile takeover proposition, another cryptic tweet from the world’s richest man has set the ball of speculations rolling.\n",
            "There are nascent assumptions about Musk pulling back his offer to buy Twitter, which is unlikely to happen. However, as highlighted by him in his SEC bid, there are chances, he might even reconsider his share in the company if his offer is not accepted. “If the deal doesn’t work, given that I don’t have confidence in management nor do I believe I can drive the necessary change in the public market. I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder,” the Tesla CEO had said categorically.\n",
            "The ball has always been in Elon Musk’s court over his Twitter propositions. However,  it is to be seen whether the Twitter board and management manage to stop him from completing his hostile takeover of the micro-blogging platform.\n",

            "I spent Easter agonising over whether to throw the considerable weight of this column behind Elon Musk’s maverick $43 billion bid for Twitter. One thing I didn’t do, however, was consult the multitude of opinions on the matter available via Twitter itself, because I’m afraid I regard it as a satanic cacophony of misinformation and vanity. If that puts me in the position of the late-15th-century scholar who said ‘Printing presses? Pah! The only news I trust is handwritten by monks’, so be it. But when I read Musk’s claim that ‘civilisational risk’ would be decreased by his sole ownership of the ubiquitous microblogging site, I laughed out loud.\n",
            "Not that I think Musk a fool. On the contrary, his leadership of Tesla since he bought into the fledgling electric car company in 2004 really has contributed to civilisation, in the sense that it has pioneered the global automotive industry’s post-carbon transition. And despite a notably loose grasp of corporate governance and an extraordinarily lucky ride on a tech-crazy stock market, he’s a pretty shrewd financier.\n",
            "But he’s also, frankly, a bit bonkers: obsessed with dreams of building cities on Mars; prone to public weed-smoking and strangely inarticulate interviews; deluded, we might suspect, by the adulation of a vast army of online admirers. His Twitter bid may not even be serious: there’s no indication how he’d finance it, the market hasn’t embraced it – and neither, in conclusion, will this column. Keep your wandering focus firmly on Tesla, Mr Musk.\n",
            "Virtuoso investor\n",
            "The contrarian New York investor John Paulson will go down in history as one of the monsters of the 2008 financial crisis, having earned $4 billion out of others’ folly by betting that the US mortgage-backed securities market would implode. His fortunes since then have been more mixed. But he did one good thing for the world in 2013 when he bought – for half a billion dollars, outbidding the private equity firm Kohlberg – the Steinway piano company, whose concert grands, built in Hamburg and the New York borough of Queens, have been favoured by virtuosi from Rachmaninoff to Brendel and are unmatched in craftsmanship by any Chinese rip-off factory: even Lang Lang prefers Steinways.\n",
            "Founded by a German immigrant in 1853, Steinway passed out of family ownership and was listed on the New York stock exchange before Paulson took it private again. His investment came with a sentimental spin – his sisters were pianists and his Ecuadorian--born father could not afford a Steinway for them – but also with his characteristic nose for value. In 2018 there were rumours he might sell to Poly Group, a Chinese conglomerate with military links; he didn’t, but now he’s planning to refloat the company with a billion-plus valuation while retaining control and taking the game to China by exploiting Steinway’s luxury-brand status to sell lots more pianos there: contrarian thinking in a more admirable form.\n",
            "City princelings\n",
            "My starting salary as a graduate trainee at a posh merchant bank in 1976 was £2,800 a year, equivalent to three-quarters of average male pay at that time and to £22,000 in today’s money. This year, I read, entry-level bankers can expect £63,000 before bonuses, which is double average UK pay and makes them three times more valued than I was. In another part of the City, newly qualified solicitors (usually two years out of university) in ‘magic circle’ law firms such as Freshfields are offered up to £125,000, likewise a multiple of previous generations’ rewards.\n",
            "From airlines to abattoirs, every corner of the employment market is afflicted by shortages of labour, skilled or unskilled. It’s surely to the good of the UK economy, in which financial and professional services count for so much, that City employers are paying up for talent that might otherwise go elsewhere. This scramble to attract the best is, after all, a reflection of the confidence of the firms concerned, and we might also see it as a welcome turnaround from post-2008, when private-sector graduate recruitment withered and many bright youngsters fell back on civil service drudgery, precarious start-ups or barista work. Now the pendulum of capitalism has swung and – as real incomes beyond the City shrink under an onslaught of inflation and tax – these pampered princelings and princesses may prefer another autumn and winter of working from home, rather than running a gauntlet of furious protestors outside their marbled office-palaces.\n",
            "Bookshop resistance\n",
            "Senior departures at Blackwell’s, the Oxford-based bookshop chain that includes Heffers of Cambridge, follow its takeover in late February by Waterstones – which already has Foyles, Hatchards and numerous other acquisitions under its belt, with the backing of a deep-pocketed investor called Elliott Advisers, and is run by James Daunt, who has six eponymous bookshops of his own. That might look like over--consolidation were it not for the relentless advance of Amazon, deploying ultra-low overheads and shameless tax policies to lay waste to the brave resistance of physical bookselling.\n",
            "Online sales now account for more than half the UK book market, but Waterstones’ fightback – with 1,000 independent sellers in support – continues to remind us of the pleasure of handling printed works before buying. Now the pandemic ‘streaming boom’ is over (UK households reportedly cancelled 1.5 million video subscriptions in the first quarter) and the cost of living is rocketing, we’ve all got more time for reading and less cash for going out; a good book is surely a better use for a tenner that barely buys you a gin and tonic. Just don’t fall into the customer habit that so irritated the shop owner Shaun Bythell of Wigtown in Scotland, in his charming Diary of a Bookseller, of browsing at length, then ordering the chosen book cheaper from Amazon on your phone before you’ve even left the premises.\n",

            "Yesterday, Warner Bros. Discovery announced it was shutting down CNN+, the extensively hyped but extremely short-lived streaming service. It will close on April 30, for a total run of less than five weeks. “Well, that was fast,” said Scott Galloway, a professor who was planning to host a CNN+ show on business. Quibi, the ill-fated video platform that was streaming’s previous cautionary tale, lasted seven months.\n",
            "More than 300 employees work at CNN+, and the network said it would try to transfer them to open positions in the company. Layoffs are likely for the rest. The news came days after Netflix said it expected to lose two million subscribers this quarter, raising doubts about the increasingly crowded field of streaming services, The Times’s Michael Grynbaum, John Koblin and Benjamin Mullin write.\n",
            "Where did it all go wrong? CNN sunk $300 million into the streaming service, according to The Wall Street Journal, hiring big-name anchors, including the former “Fox News Sunday” host Chris Wallace and the former NPR host Audie Cornish. CNN+ carried only unique programming to avoid running afoul of CNN’s agreements with cable carriers. In the end, it drew far fewer viewers than expected. It also had a powerful skeptic: Discovery C.E.O. David Zaslav, who earlier this month became the head of the newly formed Warner Bros. Discovery, becoming the new owner of CNN after its parent, WarnerMedia, was sold by AT&T.\n",
            "Some of the reasons for a shutdown have to do with the reality of mergers. The fact that CNN’s management pushed forward with the launch of CNN+ instead of waiting for the OK from its new corporate leaders appears to have ruffled feathers. Last week, on the first business day of Discovery’s ownership of WarnerMedia, marketing of CNN+ was suspended. (Zaslav has promised $3 billion in cost savings from the merger.) In a meeting with CNN+ staff yesterday, Chris Licht, CNN’s incoming president, compared the service to a residential property that had been constructed without the input of its intended owner. “Then the new owner came in and said: ‘What a beautiful house! But I need an apartment,’” he said, according to a recording reviewed by The New York Times.\n",

            "What comes next? The shutdown raises questions for other media companies looking to start streaming services. The Warner Bros. Discovery chiefs appear to believe the future of streaming is in all-in services. The company seems likely to merge a CNN offering with its other subscription platforms — Discovery+ and HBO Max — creating one giant streaming service. “This back and forth is the talk of the media biz right now,” wrote Brian Stelter, CNN’s own media critic, in his newsletter yesterday. “It’s likely going to become a business school case study.”\n",

In a filing that detailed the funding, he also said that he was exploring whether to launch a hostile takeover for the social media company. The details put more pressure on Twitter’s board to take his offer seriously, after his initial bare-bones bid was received skeptically by Wall Street.\n",

            "What we know: Morgan Stanley and a group of other lenders are offering $13 billion in debt financing and another $12.5 billion in loans against Mr. Musk’s stock in Tesla. A dozen banks are offering those loans at a 20 percent loan-to-value ratio, which implies that Musk is pledging more than $60 billion in Tesla stock as collateral, a significant chunk of his holding in the electric car company.\n",
            "What we don’t know: Musk’s funding plan also includes $21 billion in equity financing, and analysts question whether he is willing to put up this cash on his own. Private equity firms are wary of getting involved in a bitter takeover battle, The Times previously reported, potentially ruling out a number of partners. “Who will be willing to cut 10- and 11-figure checks to participate in Elon’s Big Adventure if that adventure is going to be a bare-knuckles brawl?” wrote Don Bilson, an analyst at the research firm Gordon Haskett.

            "At Goldman Sachs, data on workers’ badge swipes has been discussed during the company’s weekly meeting of investment bank managers, people familiar with the situation told DealBook. In one of the meetings, managers discussed how to compel bankers to come into the office, such as by scheduling in-office appointments with colleagues on days those people are known to be working remotely.\n",
            "Some managers are wary of having to take attendance. “I’m a busy person, too, and the thought of being a monitor like we’re in junior high again is horrible,” said Sara Baer-Sinnott, the president of Oldways, a nutrition organization in Boston with a staff of 10.\n",

            "The Tesla CEO took to his Twitter page (home to many bad tweets) to personally confirm a rumor swirling around that he had turned down an opportunity to work with Bill Gates over some good old-fashioned rich guy beef. It all started earlier that evening, when an account called Whole Mars Catalog posted several screenshots allegedly showing a text exchange between Musk and Gates. \n",
            "In the conversation, Musk asks Gates if he has a $500 million short stock position against Tesla. In investor-speak, that means Gates would financially benefit if Tesla’s value falls, rather than the traditional investing method of putting money into a stock and hoping it succeeds. Gates confirms he does, brings up the possibility of the two doing philanthropic work together, and is promptly shut down by Musk for, uh, hoping Tesla fails.\n",
            "The original post made it clear that the veracity of the texts hadn’t been confirmed, but Musk did the thing Musk does and hopped in himself. He said it was real, but that he didn’t leak it. (Mashable has not confirmed the authenticity of the text exchange.)\n",
            "What does this mean for you and I? Not much, really. It’s mostly just Musk being a little messy about an alleged conversation that occurred between he and another guy who is absurdly wealthy. I guess this is what rich people argue about. Knowing Musk, it might be smart to consider the possibility that the texts aren’t real. You never know.\n",

            "It’s been a wild month of news for the social network that we collectively love to hate. In early April, Elon Musk took a bite out of Twitter, coming away with 9.2% of the company and plans to exercise his influence over the company through its board. After that he backed out of his planned board seat, Musk teed up an even more outrageous plan: He’d buy the company outright and take it private. Absolutely everyone freaked out about this and had an opinion and some of those opinions cast doubt on the seriousness of the famously unserious tech mogul’s grand plans.\n",
            "Musk’s $43 billion offer valued Twitter for less than it was trading for a year ago, begging the question: Is this guy for real? We still don’t really know — Musk is mercurial and notoriously prone to big dumb stunts — but apparently he’s cobbling together the cash with some help from Morgan Stanley and Bank of America. \n",
            "Musk is the world’s richest man, but he’s also relatively cash poor for a mega-billionaire, so making his play on Twitter would require him to cash out shares held at Tesla and SpaceX, the two companies he’s ostensibly running while whipping us all into a frenzy over his totally unnecessary ambitions to buy Twitter and reshape it in his image. Meanwhile Twitter is working to fend of Musk’s advances with a poison pill defense, which would let existing shareholders buy more stock at low, low prices, effectively diluting the company’s shares and pushing the price of his bid up. \n",
            "Because it’s Musk we’re talking about, it’s anyone’s guess what happens next, but here’s what’s happened so far. We will provide updates as the story continues to unfold.  \n",
            "A timeline of the Elon Musk-Twitter saga\n",
            "1.  US regulators said someone should really monitor Elon Musk’s tweets\n",
            "Before Musk even placed a bid for Twitter, SEC regulators said they have authority to subpoena the Tesla CEO about his tweets and even urged a federal judge not to let the executive get away with tweeting with abandon.\n",
            "2.  Elon Musk tweets that he’s “giving serious thought” to building his own social media platform\n",
            "Shortly after U.S. regulators urged a judge to monitor Musk’s tweets, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO expressed he was giving serious thought to build the ‘next Twitter.’\n",
            "3.  Elon Musk buys 9.2% share of Twitter on April 4th\n",
            "Twitter published a note confirming that the SpaceX and Tesla entrepreneur has taken a 9.2% share of the company, working out to around $2.9 billion based on Friday’s (March 4th) share price.\n",
            "4. Elon Musk snags a board seat at Twitter the next day, April 5th\n",
            "Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal announced that Elon Musk was appointed to Twitter’s board in a series of tweets:\n",
            "5. In major reversal, Elon Musk will no longer be joining Twitter’s board, announced April 10\n",
            "Later that same week, Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal announced he would not be joining the social media firm’s board. The disclosure from Agrawal follows a series of unusual tweets from Elon Musk over the same weekend in which he wondered aloud to his over 80 million followers if Twitter was dying, citing low frequency of tweets from some of the most popular personalities on the social network.\n",
            "6. A Twitter shareholder sues after Musk fails to promptly disclose his huge investment in Twitter\n",
            "A Twitter shareholder sued Musk in a federal securities class action lawsuit because Musk failed to disclose his 5% stake in Twitter when he was required to do so. The delay allowed Musk to buy more shares of Twitter at a lower price and cheat sellers of Twitter stock out of increased profits, the plaintiff claims.\n",
            "7. Elon Musk offers to buy Twitter, the whole company, for $43 billion on April 14\n",
            "The billionaire said he is willing to pay $54.20 per share to buy 100% of the company. It would be an all-cash offer that values the social network at $43.4 billion. He filed the offer with SEC and tweeted it out hours before he was interviewed on Ted.\n",
            "8. Elon Musk does an interview at Ted hours after sending Twitter his big offer\n",
            "The controversial CEO of Tesla and SpaceX was already preparing to speak at the TED2022 conference for a conversation that was in such high demand that TED made the livestream available to the public.\n",
            "9. The following day, April 15th, Twitter’s board turns toward the defense everyone anticipated: the poison pill\n",
            "Twitter’s board of directors announced in a press release that the company is adopting a limited duration shareholder rights plan — a “poison pill” in merger and acquisition lingo. While the company doesn’t name Elon Musk directly, Twitter is clearly trying to prevent the billionaire from buying the social network.\n",
            "10. Elon Musk breaks down how he’d fund his $43 billion bid for Twitter\n",
            "To summarize: Musk intends to borrow around $13 billion in various fashions; borrow $12.5 billion against his own equity holdings; and pay around $21 billion from his own holdings. It’s a somewhat complicated collection of funding sources, but Musk’s bid is hardly small, so the path to collecting the needed cash in one pile is understandably convoluted.\n",

Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company.”\n",

            "Fending off Musk’s $43 billion offer by creating more shares could dilute the value of shareholders’ stock — but Twitter’s 10 board members own just a tiny portion, Musk noted in an April 16 tweet: “The Twitter board collectively owns almost no shares! Objectively, their economic interests are simply not aligned with shareholders.”\n",

            "After backing out of an agreement to take a seat on the board, Musk is threatening to cut board salaries to zero, a move he says will save the company nearly $3 million a year. Each non-employee board member earned $225,000 in stock in 2021, according to Twitter’s public filings. Directors, with the exception of Dorsey and his co-founder, CEO Parang Agrawal, also received $12,500 in cash, plus extra fees, ranging from $2,500 to $7,500, for serving on various board committees.\n",
            "So who are these Twitter board members fighting Musk’s hostile bid? Twitter — which has come under fire for censorship, in part for banning the New York Post’s coverage of Hunter Biden’s laptop — is filled with a motley mix of tech vets, retail gurus, academics, philanthropists and former government officials.\n",

Rather than disrupting, they are all about maintaining the status quo as they ignore their fiduciary duties to maximize shareholder value and act with the best interests of Twitter as a company.”\n",

            "Twitter already has a problem protecting users from abuse on this platform, and this move from Elon to own the company would only serve to harm the millions of people on the site.\n",
            "Twitter has become a platform, not just for our personal thoughts, but also a home for activists and a source used by millions to learn more about societal problems, and international and local news that isn’t covered by more prominent cable news. With Elon Musk at the helm of Twitter, he'll no doubt continue to use scare tactics against reports and journalists who critique him publicly.\n",
            "Why is this important?\n",
            "Elon Musk—Tesla CEO and as of January 2022, the richest man on Earth —just made a $43 BILLION offer to buy Twitter. Why’s this terrifying, you ask?\n",
            "This move from Musk signals what many financial experts are calling a hostile takeover of Twitter, a company and platform that Musk is already owns 9% of already.\n",
            "Earlier this week, Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal announced Musk would be joining the board, before saying that Musk had changed his mind and decided not to join the board. That decision left the door open for Musk to bid to own Twitter outright.\n",
            "Elon Musk isn’t fooling anyone, Twitter is one of the largest social media platforms on the planet. While Musk claims he’ll support “free speech,” we know most of the time that’s code for a free pass on racism, homophobia, transphobia and just blatant disinformation.\n",
            "The effort from the ultra-wealthy to take control of news outlets to craft their own narratives is not new (case in point: google Rupert Murdoch), but we find it ridiculous that during a deadly global pandemic, the rich just got richer. And now, Elon Musk—who paid $0 in income tax in 2007, despite his growing wealth—can now easily afford a $43B deal to take control of a platform we all enjoy. It’s time to fight back.\n",

            "Elon Musk's offer to buy Twitter, turn it into a private company, and correct what he feels is the company's waning commitment to free speech principles has drawn both praise and criticism. Many people who share Musk's dissatisfaction with the platform—including Republicans and conservatives who think it discriminates against provocative right-wing speech—are eager to see Twitter in his hands. At the same, many supporters of the establishment media say they're worried that Musk's approach would mean more harassment and disinformation on the platform.\n",
            "Twitter's board has given every indication that it sides with the traditional gatekeepers of information and that it is inclined to fend off Musk's bid. The company adopted a poison pill approach late last week. This is a well-known corporate tactic intended to thwart a potential buyer. In this case, Twitter would flood the market with additional shares available for sale if Musk's stake in the company reached 15 percent. Effectively, Twitter plans to dilute his stake and make it much harder for him to reach the 51 percent threshold. And if Twitter is ultimately interested in Musk's offer, this gives the board more time to consider it, and time as well to look for other potential buyers.\n",
            "We thus have a pretty good idea what the board of Twitter wants: It wants to hold onto power. The board's offer to make Musk a member was probably born of a desire to control and quiet him; as a board member, he would have an obligation not to publicly disparage the company, and thus he would no longer be able to tweet his thoughts about all the ways Twitter should be different.\n",
            "What, exactly, does Musk want to change about Twitter? He offered some thoughts during a TED interview last week.\n",
            "\"I think it's very important for there to be an exclusive arena for free speech,\" said Musk. \"Twitter has become sort of the de facto town square, and it's really important that people have the reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law. One of the things that I believe Twitter should do is open source the algorithm and make any changes to people's tweets, if they are emphasized or de-emphasized, that action should be made apparent so that anyone could see that action has been taken, so there's no sort of beyond the scenes manipulation.\"\n",
            "Later in that interview, Musk endorsed a feature many people have demanded: a Twitter edit button, so users could alter tweets after sending them. Facebook has this function, so it must be workable in some sense. (On Facebook, a little note appears showing that the post was edited.)\n",
            "Musk also talked about removing ads for premium subscribers and providing other perks for those willing to pay more.\n",
            "It's hard to argue that these proposals lack merit. More transparency would be a massive improvement: It's critical for users to know why and how the platform decides to reward and punish certain tweets. The ultimate goal should be to devolve content moderation to users. Instead of Twitter deciding for users what it thinks they ought to see—what it thinks is dangerous, or true, or safe—the platform should give individuals more options to curate their Twitter experiences.\n",

            "Boring Co. aims to “solve traffic” by building transportation networks in tunnels deep underground. The company already has a tunnel system in place at the Las Vegas Convention Center, and ferried around passengers at the CES conference earlier this year. The company aims to expand in other cities in coming years, and said it would use the new funding to “significantly increase hiring.”\n",

            "Boring’s “technology is now past the state-of-the-art, and improving at an exponential rate,” Sequoia Capital’s Shaun Maguire wrote in a blog post. \n",
            "Musk has long-standing connections to Sequoia. An early Musk company that facilitated payments online, X.com, was backed by Sequoia’s Mike Moritz, although after the company merged with another startup and became PayPal, Musk would be fired as chief executive officer amid management disagreements. Sequoia’s Roelof Botha worked at PayPal as chief financial officer.\n",

            "Boring has evolved over the years since its founding in 2016, when its vision was long-haul transportation over hundreds of miles. Now, it specializes in shorter trips within cities -- with some easier to work in than others. Planned projects in Chicago, Los Angeles, and a connection between Washington and Baltimore have fizzled, even as the Vegas project has won kudos.\n",
            "The new funding round includes strategic investments by real estate companies, including Brookfield, Lennar Corp., Tishman Speyer and Dacra Development Corp. That could indicate that Boring Co. is trying to integrate its tunnels into new building projects, as it has done with two hotels in Las Vegas.\n",

            "Cheyenne, Wyo. – From algae farming to producing a sort of artificial limestone, ideas for reducing greenhouse gas in the atmosphere are getting a funding boost from famed entrepreneur Elon Musk.\n",
            "The Tesla electric vehicle and SpaceX rocket company developer is bankrolling a $100 million XPRIZE Carbon Removal competition for the most promising ways to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide by grabbing the gas right out of the air.\n",
            "The 15 early-phase “milestone round” winners were announced Friday and each will get $1 million, a welcome boost for the teams to carry on with and scale up their work.\n",
            "“What we’ve said is you haven’t given us a million bucks; what you’ve done is catalyzed investment in this technology,” said Mike Kelland, CEO of Planetary Technologies, a milestone winner that seeks to increase the ocean’s ability to absorb carbon dioxide by controlling the rising acidity of seawater.\n",
            "The milestone winners aren’t necessarily ahead or favored for the $80 million in final prize money that will be awarded in three years. Until Dec. 1, 2023, anyone can still jump in the contest, which was announced a year ago, and potentially get a share of that money.\n",
            "The final winning team or teams will need to show they can remove 1,100 tons (1,000 metric tons) of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year, show how much it would cost to remove up to 1.1 million tons (1 million metric tons) per year and show a path to removing billions of tons of carbon dioxide per year.\n",
            "A third party – neither the participants nor XPRIZE – will independently validate the work submitted for the grand prize to be announced on April 20, 2025.\n",
            "XPRIZE announced $5 million in carbon removal project awards to university student teams last fall. The milestone winners announced Friday propose a variety of ways to remove carbon dioxide through artificial means and by helping nature do much of the work herself.\n",
            "Planetary Technologies isn’t looking up into the sky but down in the ocean to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide. The Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada-based company proposes to use antacids produced from the leftovers of metal mining to make the ocean more able to absorb the greenhouse gas.\n",
            "“If we kind of ignore the ocean – say we’re trying to do this on land, we’re trying to store it in the ground – we’re just not going to make it,” Kelland said. “That’s sort of the opinion of a lot of these scientists working in this field.”\n",
            "Durham, North Carolina-based 8 Rivers Capital, sees ocean chemistry as a model to replicate. The winning company seeks to trap atmospheric carbon dioxide in calcium carbonate crystals, similar to how the gas dissolved in the ocean helps form seashells and limestone.\n",
            "Company spokesperson Adam Goff described the process as “poetic” in a way.\n",
            "“The calcium cycle is how the earth regulates its CO2 over millions of years. We’re sort of speeding up that natural cycle,” Goff said.\n",
            "Global Algae, based in Santee, California, won with a plan to cultivate algae to help restore rain forests, which capture huge volumes of carbon dioxide. Algae can be a more efficient and more profitable alternative to the cattle ranching and soy and palm oil crops currently on cleared rain forest land, said Mark Hazlebeck, a principal of the family-owned company.\n",
            "“We’re actually creating more oil and protein while we’re reforesting at the same time,” Hazlebeck said.\n",
            "The prize announcement comes as the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns in ever-starker terms of the threat of rising global temperatures, including worsening heat, fires, storms and droughts.\n",
            "“We still need more – more and deeper emissions cuts, and more reliable, validated carbon removal solutions. That’s why we launched this prize,” said Marcius Extavour, chief scientist and vice president of climate and environment at XPRIZE.\n",
            "XPRIZE is a technology promotion organization known in part for a contest that encouraged development of a privately funded, reusable spacecraft in 2004. Last year, two teams that showed they could profitably trap carbon dioxide from smokestacks in concrete split a $15 million XPRIZE award.\n",
            "“Even if we stopped CO2 production, that’s probably still not enough,” XPRIZE founder and executive chairman Peter Diamandis said in a 2021 chat with Musk posted on the XPRIZE website. “We do need mechanisms for extraction of CO2 from the atmosphere and the oceans that don’t exist right now.”\n",
            "The risk of climate disaster could become “dire” if the trend of higher greenhouse gas concentrations continues alongside human population growth and industrialization, Musk replied.\n",
            "“It’s probably an unwise experiment to run,” Musk said. “Right now, we’ve only got one planet. Even if 0.1% chance of disaster, why run that risk? It’s crazy.”\n",

            "It seems Gates recently tried to end the beef between the pair, texting Elon about \"philanthropy possibilities\" they could discuss. However, Musk quickly shot down the opportunity. He mentioned Gates' short position on Tesla, which is rumored to be in the region of $500 million.\n",
            "The texts are real, as confirmed by Musk. It seems they were leaked by \"friends of friends\".\n",
            "Gates has frequently spoken about Tesla and Musk in interviews. Although he often praises the automaker, in a February 2021 interview with Bloomberg he all but confirmed he shorted TSLA. Interestingly, for someone so into sustainability and climate change awareness, Bill Gates didn't drive an electric car until 2020. In an interview with YouTuber Marques Brownlee Gates mentioned that he bought a Porsche Taycan and it was his first electric car. \n",
            "Elon Musk is currently the richest person on earth, with a $264 billion net worth. Meanwhile, Bill Gates is the fourth wealthiest with a $132 billion net worth. Gates was frequently the richest man on earth on numerous occasions from the 1990s to the mid-2010s.\n",

            "Elon Musk has now put together a $46.5bn financing package to buy Twitter — two thirds of it from his own assets, and a third from bank loans secured against Twitter’s assets. It’s the biggest acquisition financing ever put forward for one person.\n",
            "Twitter’s founder and top managers don’t want Musk to take over the company. They offered him a seat on the board but he didn’t want it because he’d have to be responsible to all other shareholders. Now they’re adopting a “poison pill” to stop him. But Musk plans to buy shares directly with a tender offer that shareholders can’t refuse. After all, it’s a free market.\n",
            "Musk says no one should object to what he wants to do with Twitter because he’s a “free speech absolutist,” and who can be against free speech? Besides, he and his apologists say, if consumers don’t like what he does with Twitter they can go elsewhere. Freedom to choose.\n",
            "Free market? Free speech? Free choice?\n",
            "When billionaires like Musk justify their motives by using “freedom,” beware. What they actually seek is freedom from accountability. They want to use their vast fortunes to do whatever they please — unconstrained by laws or regulations, shareholders, or even consumers\n",
            "The “free market” increasingly reflects the demands of big money. Unfriendly takeovers, such as Musk is mounting at Twitter, weren’t part of the “free market” until the late 1970s and early 1980s. Before then, laws and regulations constrained them. Then came corporate raiders like Carl Icahn and Michael Milken. Their MO was to find corporations whose assets were worth more than their stock value, borrow against them, acquire enough shares to force them to cut costs (such as laying off workers, abandoning their communities, busting unions, and taking on crushing debt), and cash in.\n",
            "But the raiders’ antics often imposed huge social costs. They pushed America from stakeholder capitalism (where workers and communities had a say in what corporations did) to shareholder capitalism (where the sole corporate goal is to maximize shareholder value). Inequality skyrocketed, insecurity soared, vast swaths of America were abandoned, and millions of good jobs vanished.\n",
            "The raiders altered the “free market” to allow them to do this. That’s what the super-rich do. There’s no “free market” in nature. The “free market” depends on laws and rules. If you have enough money, you can buy changes in those laws and rules that make you even more money. (You can also get the government to subsidize you — Musk has received a reported $4.9bn so far.)\n",
            "“Free speech” is another freedom that turns on wealth. As a practical matter, your ability to be heard turns on the size of the megaphone you can buy. If you’re extremely rich you can purchase the Washington Post or own Fox News. If you’re the wealthiest person in the world you can buy one of the biggest megaphones in the world called Twitter — and then decide who can use it, what its algorithms are going to be, and how it either invites or filters out big lies.\n",
            "Musk said last week that he doesn’t care about the economics of the deal and is pursuing it because it is “extremely important to the future of civilization.” Fine, but who anointed Musk to decide the future of civilization?\n",
            "Which brings us to free choice. If consumers don’t like what Musk does with Twitter, they cannot simply switch to another Twitter-like platform. There aren’t any. The largest social media platforms have grown gigantic because anyone who wants to participate in them and influence debate has to join them. After they reach a certain size, they’re the only megaphone in town. Where else would consumers go to post short messages that can reach tens of millions of people other than Twitter?\n",
            "With social media, the ordinary rules of competition don’t apply. Once a platform is dominant it becomes even more dominant. As Donald Trump discovered with his “Truth Social” fiasco, upstarts don’t stand much chance.\n",
            "Musk’s real goal has nothing to do with the freedom of others. His goal is his own unconstrained freedom – the freedom to wield enormous power without having to be accountable to laws and regulations, to shareholders, or to market competition — which is why he’s dead set on owning Twitter.\n",
            "Unlike his ambitions to upend transportation and interstellar flight, this one is dangerous. It might well upend democracy.\n",

            "“Hollywood refuses to write even one story about an actual company startup where the CEO isn’t a dweeb and/or evil,” Elon Musk recently whined on Twitter. If this were the case, there would be an obvious explanation: start-up CEOs are all evil dweebs. But the premise of Musk’s argument falls apart quickly, as the sad reality is that Hollywood isn’t demonising Silicon Valley CEOs anywhere near enough.\n",
            "I recently went through a phase of watching classic blockbusters from the 80s and 90s (Aliens, Total Recall, RoboCop, Gremlins 2 – that kind of thing) and I was struck by how often these films featured smarmy yuppies as antagonists, often acting as the human face of an evil corporation. These characters were truly loathsome, nasty pieces of work; avatars of the worst excesses of the Reagan years who would inevitably get their well-earned comeuppance. In terms of both malign influence on the world and sheer obnoxiousness, the Tech Bro has surpassed the City Boy as the archetypal villain of the age. And yet, with a few less than stellar exceptions, Hollywood hasn’t looked to Silicon Valley as a source of antagonism as it did with Wall Street in the 80s. This year has seen the release of a number of new TV shows which could have reversed this decline: The Dropout (about Theranos), WeCrashed (about WeWork) and Super-Pumped: The Battle for Uber. But through clumsy attempts at exoneration, these shows have failed to deliver the villains we deserve. Tech CEOs like Elon Musk shouldn’t be lambasting Hollywood for depicting them unfairly, they should instead be thanking it on their hands and knees for giving them such an easy ride.\n",

            "It’s true that there have been a smattering of Tech Bro villains over the last decade. David Fincher’s 2010 The Social Network doesn’t pull its punches in terms of depicting Marky Z as a creep. Jesse Eisenberg played a slimy Zuckerberg-esque Lex Luthor in the roundly reviled Batman vs Superman (2016), and 2014’s Kingsman: The Secret Service features Samuel L Jackson as a streetwear-clad tech titan who wants to cull the world’s population in an effort to stop climate change. Don’t Look Up – Adam McKay’s smug, didactic satire about climate change – saw a greedy tech CEO consign the world to obliteration. Aside from a handful of TV shows and a smattering of minor Marvel villains, that’s about it. \n",
            "The decline of the evil yuppie comes alongside the attendant decline of another archetype: the Evil Corporation. “I would say that in terms of popcorn entertainment, it has disappeared,” Jesse Hawken, film critic and host of the podcast Junk Filter, tells Dazed. “When it comes to mainstream cinema, today it’s more about bad actors within a corporation, as opposed to the actual mechanics of the corporation itself. You can contrast that with something like Robocop which is explicitly about the dangers of privatisation.” You can see this at play in the spate of Silicon Valley films and TV shows, which rarely act as an indictment of the tech industry itself; while there might be some hand-wringing about the dangers of hype, the problem is usually an individual excess of ambition. \n",
            "According to Hawken, the decline of anti-corporate messaging is partly because the economy of Hollywood has changed in the intervening years. While there have always been big corporations involved in major studio filmmaking, today this involvement is far more direct. “I don’t think any executives of 20th Century Fox in 1979 were worried that a movie might have an anti-capitalist or pro-working-class message,” he says. “But today nobody’s going to get a lot of corporate support if they want to make a new blockbuster about an evil corporation. On a huge box office level, the movies that spend a lot of money to make a lot of money play it safe more than anything. They want to make sure that the highest number of people like the film, so the most you could ask for in any kind of anti-corporate messaging in a movie is surface level. If there were a bad guy in a corporation, he would be acting alone. Contrast that with somebody like Carter Burke from Aliens [the yuppie villain]: he’s a company man and the evil stuff that he does is on behalf of his evil company.”\n",
            "Elizabeth Holmes – the disgraced CEO of a fraudulent start-up that falsely claimed to have revolutionised blood testing, thus endangering the health of a number of real-life patients – would be the perfect source material for a truly monstrous tech world villain. But Hulu’s The Dropout just can’t bring itself to depict her as such. It veers close, but darts away every time with some humanising detail intended to absolve her.  The Dropout is essentially an example of what critic Parul Sehgal has termed ‘the trauma plot’, whereby the actions and motivations of characters can be understood entirely in relation to their painful personal histories; in the case of Elizabeth Holmes, The Dropout suggests she started Theranos because she experienced a sexual assault in college, and was therefore motivated by a desire to ‘make people feel safe’. In the case of her partner – the odious, bullying Sunny Balwani – it’s suggested that the reason he’s so unpleasant is due to the racism he has experienced in the US (“No one thinks you’re a terrorist when you drive a Lamborghini!”) Each explanation seems crude and reductive, not to mention a little insulting to survivors of racism and sexual assault who don’t go onto launch fraudulent healthcare start-ups. \n",
            "That’s not to say these narratives are wholly untrue: people’s harmful actions often can be explained, in part, by past experiences. But often the more cogent fact is that some people are just selfish and greedy,  and enabled by an economy and culture which is every bit as corrupt as they are. What is served by portraying these people, who embody Silicon Valley at its most predatory, as sympathetic? And who is afforded this degree of clemency? Maybe this is glib, but the fact that Holmes is white, and from the right stock, makes her an easier candidate for this kind of narrative rehabilitation. Rather than a bad person (which, by any definition, she surely is), The Dropout presents her as being cursed with the fatal flaw of being too ambitious, too much of a go-getter; everything our culture rewards but taken too far. These attempts at nuance become a cop-out. It might be true that no one is wholly evil, but someone who recklessly endangered people’s health in a craven bid for status and wealth deserves to be portrayed in black-and-white terms.\n",
            "The Dropout treads an uncomfortable middle ground between hand-wringing and hagiography. If it had embraced Holmes as an Amy from Gone Girl-style sociopath, it would have been just as unsavoury but a lot more fun. Obviously, you can have a terrible person for a protagonist, but this tends to work better when you embrace their awfulness rather than trying to wriggle out of its implications: American Psycho would have been a worse film had there been a flashback, played for pathos, which explains that Patrick Bateman is the way he is because a girl once pantsed him in the playground. \n",
            "So why does it matter that these shows have failed to successfully villainise the Silicon Valley CEO? In a sense, it doesn’t. Even if The Dropout or WeCrashed were the most rousing agitprop ever committed to film, they wouldn’t inspire people to take up arms and march to the Bay Area, or even to campaign for the mildest tech industry reforms. It would be nice to think that we are doing activism simply by watching a Hulu original, but this isn’t the case: mass media is rarely a good driver of political engagement. Squid Game and Parasite were both deservedly popular, but if they’ve succeeded in fermenting any revolutionary class consciousness, this has yet to materialise. Moreover, it’s an unreasonable metric by which to judge a film or TV show, and one which leads to such absurd situations as people denouncing celebrities for hosting Squid Game-themed parties on the basis that they’ve ‘missed the point (“capitalism is bad” sailing straight over Chrissy Teigen’s head.) Even if you look at the films commonly held up as the most effective examples of political satire, the extent to which they are useful is questionable: Dr Strangelove (1964) failed to achieve nuclear armament, which has no bearing on its artistic merit. Truly subversive art tends to arise in tandem with political movements, rather than bringing them into being. If a film or television show were to pose any threat to societal order, you probably wouldn’t be able to stream it on Netflix. \n",
            "So, in a sense, the decline of anti-capitalist sentiment in Hollywood doesn’t really matter. But the yuppie villain was usually enjoyable to watch, and it’s a pity that we have been denied an equivalent catharsis today. It’s not that these depictions act as a catalyst for political change or a form of consciousness-raising, but they do offer a kind of libidinal release that, apart from anything, is fun. “I guess it’s the vicarious thrill that movies give us in general, where the good guys win and the bad guys lose. I don’t think that people really get their subversive points in that way,” says Hawken. If we do have to live underneath the boot of the Silicon Valley Tech Bros, if we are daily subject to their smug hypocrisy and corny aesthetics, then we should at the very least be afforded the visceral satisfaction of watching their fictional representations meet with retribution. No doubt we’ll soon be treated to a wry, subtly absolving dramedy about Tesla: if it doesn’t involve Elon Musk being eaten by an alien or blown up by a robot, then you can count me out.\n",

            "His comments are symptomatic of his distrust and active dislike of the mainstream media. For years, Musk has criticized journalists, calling them liars and claiming newspapers were in the pockets of advertisers.\n",
            "Just last month, Musk called out The Washington Post for being owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, telling a reporter there to “give my regards to your puppetmaster.”\n",

            "But what he’s failing to acknowledge is the fact that there’s a considerable vested interest behind practically everything he says.\n",
            "While claiming that Tesla will have a functioning humanoid robot ready in the next two years — in the same interview no less —  may be a stab in the dark for the billionaire, it sends a clear sign to shareholders, who are now presumably expecting the car company to have something to show.\n",
            "ADVERTISEMENT\n",
            "Is Musk really asking journalists to ignore his many predictions? Perhaps it’s just another piece of evidence that Musk doesn’t always think too much before he speaks.\n",
            "Besides, there’s a simple way for him to prevent people from calling him out on his eyebrow-raising predictions — by not making them in the first place.\n",

The exchange showed Musk had turned own a philanthropic opportunity with Gates as the Tesla CEO asked him if he had taken a short position ndash; betting a stock price will fall by selling a stock they've borrowed to buy it back at a lower price ndash; on Tesla. The leaked texts show Musk asking Gates: Do you still have a half billion dollar short position against Tesla?Gates responded: Sorry to say I haven't closed it out. He added: I would like to discuss philanthropy possibilities.Musk appeared to shut down the potential partnership, writing: Sorry, but I cannot take your philanthropy on climate change seriously when you have a massive short position against Tesla, the company doing the most to solve climate change.Gates appears to have previously hit out at the SpaceX founder when he was asked about his views last year on some billionaires' focus on space travel.

            "For example, Teslahas gained over 21,000% over the last decade and surpassed $1 trillion in market capitalization despite being the most shorted stock of all time.\n",
            "\"Twitter has extraordinary potential. I will unlock it,\" Musk said in a letter to Twitter chairman Bret Taylor.\n",
            "In an interview with Insider, Morningstar senior equity analyst Ali Mogharabi laid out four ways Musk could improve Twitter's fortunes.\n",
            "Higher engagement\n",
            "Musk has about 83 million followers on Twitter, and given his huge success leading other companies, more users would likely flock to the platform in the event of a takeover, Mogharabi explained.\n",
            "His popularity alone could have a significant impact in attracting and retaining people, even if he made no changes. But as Musk has talked fervently about easing content restrictions, existing users could become more engaged.\n",
            "\"Engagement should increase and then the increase in engagement will bring in even more users, and they'll spend more time on the platform,\" Mogharabi told Insider.\n",
            "Leadership and efficiency\n",
            "Musk has transformed Tesla and SpaceX from upstarts to leaders in the auto and space industries, respectively. SpaceX is now the second-most valuable private company with a$100 billion valuation. And his tunnel-making venture Boring Company just completed a $675 million funding round that values it at $5.675 billion.\n",
            "He could bring that same visionary leadership to Twitter, Mogharabi said.\n",
            "\"Look at what he's done with other companies, he can really bring some innovative ideas to the platform,\" Mogharabi said. \"New features, ways to change it and he could do it all with efficiency, which Twitter has lacked in the past.\"\n",
            "He added that Musk has a knack for surrounding himself with bright minds from across industries, providing new perspectives. In addition,Musk would make sure new ideas are tested and implemented quickly and effectively, as he's done at his other companies, Mogharabi said.\n",
            "Data and advertising\n",
            "If Musk eases Twitter's content restrictions, it's possible some advertisers may not stick around. But even if some leave, Musk would be able to attract new advertisers by increasing the impact of ads.\n",
            "For example, Musk could demand more efficient use of first-party data that Twitter compiles, Mogharabi noted. \"That would increase the effectiveness of ads, which could then attract more advertisers, which would then drive top-line growth.\"\n",
            "Subscriptions\n",
            "Twitter rolled out its Twitter Blue service last June, giving subscribers access to an undo button, customizable icons, and more. Musk has talked about lowering the subscription price from $3 to $2, and Mogharabi said that could bring in new users while boosting access to fresh features.\n",
            "Musk also has said Twitter Blue users would get a blue checkmark, another incentive that could drive subscriptions.\n",
            "Leaning into the subscription model could even elevate the level of discourse, Mogharabi added, since users would be motivated to engage in higher-level conversations if they pay.\n",
            "\"Getting users to subscribe to Twitter could be positive for the company, and it could bring even higher engagement levels for people who are willing to pay to use the platform,\" he said.\n",

            "\"I don't think it is any more implausible than other claims for the potential of neurotechnology,\" Professor Andrew Jackson, an expert in neural interfaces at Newcastle University, told Insider.\n",
            "Musk made the suggestion in a TED interview on April 14, thereby adding \"morbid obesity\" to a growing list of ailments he believes Neuralink could help treat.\n",
            "Experts interviewed by Insider said a commercially-available obesity-busting brain chip was a long way off but the concept was promising if backed by the right science.\n",
            "A brain implant to lose weight?\n",
            "Founded by Musk in 2016, Neuralink is developing a microchip that's implanted into a person's skull. Tiny wires equipped with electrodes fan out from the device into the brain, allowing it to read and potentially stimulate brain activity.\n",
            "Musk has previously named a wide range of neurological disorders he believes Neuralink could treat, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. He's also made far-fetched claims about the chip potentially \"solving autism\" and creating \"symbiosis\" between humans and artificial intelligence.\n",
            "Beyond Musk's comments in his recent TED interview, there's no further information about how Neuralink could help tackle obesity.\n",
            "Broadly, though, the concept is feasible, Sadaf Farooqi, a professor of metabolism and medicine at the University of Cambridge, said.\n",
            "\"We and others have shown that in some people with severe obesity, it's the function of a particular brain region, the hypothalamus, that's really driving often an increase in appetite,\" she said.\n",
            "The hypothalamus is a gland nestled in the center of the brain that has a vital role in the control of hormone production.\n",
            "\"If you could find a way to target that particular region and even those particular neurons that drive appetite, then in theory, a drug or a technology that did that could improve the lives of patients,\" Farooqi said.\n",
            "A brain implant would also be arguably less invasive than other treatments for morbid obesity, Newcastle University's Jackson said. Some of these treatments involve changing the shape and function of a patient's digestive system.\n",
            "Early tests yield mixed results\n",
            "Some researchers are so confident in brain implant technology that they've moved to early proof-of-concept trials on humans – which have garnered mixed results.\n",
            "One trial involving six people with morbid obesity – defined in the study as a body-mass index above 40 – involved a brain implant that transmitted frequent electric pulses to the hypothalamus. According to Elemental, one participant lost more than 100 pounds, three lost a little weight but not a substantial amount, and the other two lost no weight at all.\n",
            "In a separate but similar trial, according to Elemental, only one of three participants lost weight. Another small trial is ongoing.\n",
            "\"I would say that these trials are very much at the kind of leading-edge,\" Farooqi said. \"As a result, they probably have not been that informative.\"\n",
            "\"But the fact that they have gone ahead and that there has been a bit of benefit for some people I think is encouraging.\"\n",
            "Treating the symptoms or the cause\n",
            "Francesco Rubino, chair of metabolic surgery at King's College London, said brain implant technology was promising but a chip focussing solely on appetite reduction would likely be \"set to fail.\"\n",
            "\"Anything we have tried until now that was based on that assumption has not been working,\" he said.\n",
            "New research suggests it's not only the way people eat that makes them overweight. It could also be that the body doesn't regulate weight properly by burning available fat for energy, Rubino said. \"It's like having a tank full of fuel, but having some sort of dysfunction so the fuel cannot be utilized efficiently.\"\n",
            "If you could find the trigger of the disease and target that with an implant, you could cut the problem at the source, Rubino said.\n",
            "A brain chip that can effectively fight obesity is likely a long way off. Neuralink, for one, has yet to receive approval for human testing and Musk said in his TED interview that once the company can begin implanting chips in brains, it will focus on brain and spinal injuries for \"probably a decade.\"\n",
            "Newcastle's Jackson said that as with many of Neuralink's claims, \"there is still quite a lot of science that would be needed, alongside the technology development, to deliver this as a therapy.\"\n",

            "New Delhi: RD Tata, a business partner and relative of Jamsetji Tata, and his French wife Sooni became parents to their second child, a boy, in Paris in 1904. The boy would later on grow up to make a name for himself while also giving India its very first airline - Air India!\n",
            "By now many would have guessed that this is the story of none other than JRD Tata, the man who touched the lives of rich and poor, manager and worker, alike. The second of RD and Sooni’s 5 kids, Je-hangir spent his early days with his mother in France. He was educated in France, Japan and England be-fore being drafted into the French army for a mandatory one-year period.\n",
            "JRD’s entry into the French Army\n",
            "It was in the year 1923 that JRD lost his mother, who was just 43 then. The responsibility of the children fell on RD Tata. While Jehangir wanted to study engineering at Cambridge, his father decided to move him to England for a year to study grammar. However, fate had other plans.\n",
            "That year, the French government came up with a new rule—one year of compulsory military service for the eldest boy of each family. As a citizen of France, JRD had to enlist in the army.\n",
            "JRD’s acceptance in a cavalry unit\n",
            "By mid-1924, Jehangir was accepted into a cavalry unit which was an Algerian one. While he knew horse riding, the horses in JRD’s unit were pure Arab—fast and big, unlike the French. For a year, Jehangir trained dedicatedly and improved his riding skills which led to his selection for a promotion by mid-1925.\n",
            "He had to complete a special training course to get promoted, however, the idea was rejected by his father. \"Are you mad? Enough of sour army training,” RD wrote to him. Jehangir returned to India.\n",
            "The lucky coincidence!\n",
            "RD’s denial and JRD’s return to India turned out to be life-saver for the latter, literally.\n",
            "A few days after Jehangir left, his entire cavalry unit deployed in Morocco where each and every soldier was killed. The whole unit was wiped out by the bandit leader Abdul Kareem and his men.\n",
            "A few years after moving to India, JRD renounced his French citizenship in 1929 and decided to become an Indian citizen. He lived his and how! JRD created Air India, oversaw the Tata Group’s expansion and the rest is history.\n",

The LIC board on Saturday gave its nod to cut down the issue size to 3.5 per cent from 5 per cent.\n",
            "This means that the government will dilute only 3.5 per cent of its shares worth Rs 21,000 crore as compared to 5 per cent shares announced earlier. However, the decision is subject to regulatory approval, according to an official quoted by Business Standard.\n",
            "A proposal in this regard was presented before the board today.\n",
            "The reduction in the issue size now puts India’s largest insurer’s valuation at Rs 6 trillion, which has been finalised after taking feedback from investors. The latest valuation has been fixed at 1.1 times LIC’s embedded value of Rs 5.39 trillion.\n",
            "This would need Securities and Exchange Board of India’s permission as the market regulator states that companies having a valuation over Rs 1 trillion have to dilute 5 per cent equity and Rs 5,000 worth shares.\n",

            "New Delhi: After two years of Covid-19 pandemic, things finally seem to be getting back on track and even more so for freshers! How? Well, the answer is higher pay packages. Noida-based IT company HCL Technologies has hiked the salary package of freshers from the previous Rs 3.5 lakh per year to Rs 4.25 lakh per year.\n",
            "Along with this, the IT major also introduced comprehensive increment plans for the entry level during the previous fiscal year (FY22), according to their chief human resources officer VV Apparao.\n",
            "\"Wherever the skills are at a premium, we increase the grades. If you look at the fresher talent, today, we are paying Rs 4.25 lakh per annum to graduates now,\" Apparao told Economic Times. The company’s changes in salary package and appraisal plans are aimed at attracting more talent and combatting an acute attrition challenge.\n",
            "The wage hike could be announced in July.\n",
            "With a focus now set on retention and fresher growth through its system, it will take a few more quarters for HCL before the attrition rate recedes from the current 20 per cent levels. The country’s third largest software services provider by revenue is now also broadening its base in smaller cities and abroad to see its talent base balloon.\n",
            "HCL's plans for freshers\n",
            "As part of its plan to increase the fresher base, HCL is even talking to the educational institutions where they are selecting these kids and asking the educational institutions to make it a part of the curriculum so that they complete these and join at Rs 6 lakh per annum, Apparao shared.\n",
            "This hike in package in FY22 is in addition to HCL’s existing programme that lets freshers get additional certifications to increase their compensation to Rs 6 lakh a year.\n",
            "Meanwhile, HCL Tech reported an operating margin of 18 per cent for the quarter ended March 31 and 18.9 per cent for the full fiscal year, which were at the lower end of estimates due to higher employee costs and a seasonal dip in its products and platforms (P&P) business.\n",
            "Fresher hirings at HCL\n",
            "In FY22, the IT company exceeded its guidance for fresher hires (20,000-22,000) and welcomed 23,000 recruits. For the present year, HCL has predicted nearly 34,000 fresher recruits. Of the total employee base of 208,877, HCL’s fresher intake is about 11 per cent.\n",
            "This is much less than the fresher intakes of rivals like TCS and Infosys at 16 per cent and 27 208,877 fresher intake respectively, as a share of their overall employee base in FY22.\n",
            "\"Last year, we already rolled out increments, defined fresher compensation grids and corrected the same for the previous five batches. In addition, we also rolled out a couple of retention kitties. Hence, I don't see that there would be a need for anything more than what we have given as an increment last year because it was not a standalone increment,\" Apparao said.\n",

            "New Delhi: In a major setback for fintech companies expecting to get their payment aggregator licence, the Reserve Bank of India could reject their applications owing to the connection of some of these with cryptocurrency exchanges and gaming apps.\n",
            "Online payment companies including MobiKwik and Cashfree could face the RBI heat in the backdrop of some of these fintech firms’ dealings with crypto exchanges and gaming apps, Economic Times quoted a person aware of the development as saying.\n",
            "Bengaluru-based payment and banking technology company Cashfree Payments has undergone harsh questions regarding merchant partnerships for its payouts business, know-your-customer (KYC) norms, its net-worth criteria, and for onboarding betting apps as clients.\n",
            "However, a company spokesperson said that their payment aggregator licence application is under consideration by the RBI. “We decline to comment on baseless speculation,” they added.\n",
            "RBI not okay with fintechs' dealings with crypt companies\n",
            "The RBI is clearly not okay with payment aggregators having dealings with cryptocurrency companies, or with gaming apps which have in the past been accused of being a conduit to launder money, according to a person directly aware of the development.\n",
            "“The RBI does not appreciate payment providers powering the cryptocurrency industry in any shape or form, whether it is supporting the trading or providing their platform for any other use-cases. The RBI is also taking note of what KYC norms are being followed by these payment platforms, with the remotest risk identified leading to rejections. There is no scope of negotiation this time,” the person added.\n",
            "Moreover, the central bank has also decided to dismiss the payment aggregator licence of ZaakPay, the payment gateway service of MobiKwik, the reason again being its crypto partnerships and for failing to meet the laid-down net-worth criterion.\n",
            "What is the net-worth criterion?\n",
            "The RBI rules state that payment aggregators are required to show a net worth of Rs 15 crore on the date of their applications or as of March-end 2021, and of Rs 25 crore by the end of the ongoing fiscal year.\n",
            "Last year, it was reported that several Indian payment gateways were under the ED lens for letting customers transfer money to Chinese betting apps.\n",

            "New Delhi: Reliance Industries on Saturday said its Rs 24,713-crore deal with the Future Group cannot go ahead as secured creditors of the latter have voted against it.\n",
            "In a regulatory filing, Reliance said Future Group companies comprising Future Retail Limited (FRL) and other listed companies involved in the scheme have intimated the results of the voting on the scheme of arrangement by their shareholders and creditors at their respective meetings.\n",
            "\"... The secured creditors of FRL have voted against the scheme. In view thereof, the subject scheme of arrangement cannot be implemented,\" said RIL, while updating on the scheme of arrangement for the transfer of retail and wholesale business and the logistics and warehousing business of Future Group to its subsidiary Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd (RRVL) and Reliance Retail and Fashion Lifestyle Ltd (RRFLL).\n",
            "In a regulatory filing to the stock exchanges on Friday, FRL said 69 per cent of lenders voted against the plan while 30 per cent supported it. As much as 83 per cent of the secured creditors of Future Lifestyle Fashion, the group’s second largest listed entity, also rejected the proposed sell-off to Reliance.\n",
            "Lenders to Future Group include State Bank of India, Bank of India, Bank of Baroda and HDFC Bank. Some of them turned down the deal due to the lack of commitment from RIL on the deal, Economic Times quoted people with knowledge of the matter as saying.\n",

            "There is no love lost between Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, and Microsoft founder, Bill Gates. On Musk’s end anyway. He’s known for trolling the computer software genius and climate change activist with tweets like this:\n",
            "But this time, Musk is more triggered than snarky. A recent text exchange between the two billionaires leaked, and Musk confirmed the authenticity via – you guessed it – Twitter. He accused the computer software magnate of engaging in investment practices that could cause the stock price of the company Musk helms to fall.\n",
            "Twitter account Whole Mars Catalog, which bills itself as a “part 24/7 EV news channel,” posted screenshots of the exchange, and asked Musk “is this real?”\n",

            "What does it mean to “short” a stock? Financial news website Investopedia says  “short-selling occurs when an investor borrows a security and sells it on the open market, planning to buy it back later for less money.”\n",
            "Sponsored Links\n",
            "This practice isn’t uncommon, but it is unpopular. Shorting a stock is betting against it; profiting off of its downturn. Tesla stock has long been considered to be overvalued. But that didn’t stop those “hedging” their bets against it – and losing a combined $38B in 2020.\n",
            "Nor did it stop short-sellers from continuing to play the see-saw game with the company’s perceived value. According to Barron’s, David Trainer, the CEO of New Constructs – an independent research firm – still considers the stock to be overvalued:\n",
            "“Tesla‘s market capitalization recently moved well past $1 trillion, but the independent investment-research firm New Constructs believes the company is overvalued by roughly $1 trillion of that. The firm’s CEO, David Trainer, says Tesla shares could fall as much as 88%, to roughly $150 a share,” Barron’s wrote.\n",
            "Some could say Elon Musk is being hypocritical. He has been the subject of several SEC investigations related to insider trading and stock manipulation, costing investors hundreds of millions with the posting of a single tweet – enriching himself and family members in the process.\n",
            "Those familiar with Musk and Gates’ “relationship” know that Musk has had an issue with Gates going back years. In 2017, Musk unveiled a fleet of electric semi-trucks. The rollout has been pushed back to the fall of this year. But, it was a post Gates made in his online blog GatesNotes in August 2020, criticizing the viability and practicality of electric-powered semis, that would draw Musk’s negative attention.\n",
            "“EVs excel at short-haul travel. That means they’re great options for personal cars and even medium-duty vehicles, like city buses and garbage trucks. But even if we develop cheap, long-range EVs that are powered by zero-carbon sources, electrification isn’t an option for many types of transportation,” Gates wrote.\n",
            "He also praised car manufacturers like GMC and Ford for making a foray into the electric vehicle market, increasing the options for vehicle buyers, and notably leaving Tesla off the list.\n",
            "“Increased competition in the market means there are more choices available to customers than ever before, from compact sedans to sleek sports cars. You’ll even be able to buy an all-electric pick-up truck soon thanks to legacy companies like GM and Ford and new carmakers like Rivian and Bollinger,” Gates slighted Musk’s company with the omission.\n",
            "It was a slight that did not go unnoticed by the forever attention-seeking, Musk, who dismissed Gates’ statements when asked on Twitter in September 2020.\n",
            "But he wasn’t done. On an episode of the Joe Rogan Experience Podcast, Elon Musk was asked about Gate’s comment. Musk chalked it up to Gate’s lack of knowledge about the electric vehicle industry and about the batteries that power them. According to Torque News, this led to Musk telling Rogan:\n",
            "“I’ve also heard from trusted sources Bill Gates has a short position against Tesla.” Continuing, Musk also added, “if it is true, he has lost a lot of money.”\n",
            "On an episode of CNBC‘s Squawk Box with host Andrew Ross Sorkin, Gates was given the opportunity to refute Musk’s claims and clear the air, to confirm or deny. He did neither, however. Instead, he credited Musk’s ingenuity and his contribution to combatting the climate crisis with Tesla.\n",
            "“I think what Elon has done with Tesla is fantastic, it is probably the biggest single contribution to showing us that electric cars are how we solve climate change. And now he has got a carbon removal challenge, so we need more Elon Musk’s,” Gates said.\n",
            "Known as a private person, Gates isn’t forthcoming when it comes to his private life or his investments, particularly after his messy divorce from his former wife Melinda. Despite a 52-week low of $546.98, Tesla opened Saturday morning at $1015.21. With minor fluctuations, its shares are still a far cry from Trainer’s predicted low price of $150 a share.  If Elon Musk’s accusations are true, and Gates does hold half a billion worth of shorted stock – he may want to hold onto those shares a little bit longer.\n",

            "I love my kids and I’m very proud of everything they’ve accomplished\n",
            "My oldest child, Elon, is making electric cars to save the environment and launching rockets. My middle child, Kimbal, started farm-to-table restaurants and is teaching children to build fruit and vegetable gardens in underserved schools. And Tosca, my youngest, is producing and directing films through her own entertainment company.\n",
            "People often ask me how I raised such successful kids. I tell them I did it by teaching them about hard work and letting them follow their interests.\n",
            "Put your kids to work at an early age\n",
            "I became a single mother of three when I was 31. I never felt guilty about working full-time, because I didn’t have a choice. Taking care of my children was the top priority; I worked hard to keep a roof over our heads, food in our stomach, and basic clothes on our back.\n",
            "I started working for my dad when I was eight years old. We lived next door to his chiropractic, where my mom helped him, too. My twin sister Kaye and I were paid 5 cents an hour to help him mail out his monthly bulletin.\n",
            "My dad would dictate the bulletin to my mom, who wrote it in shorthand and then typed it up. After Kaye and I made copies of the stencils, we would sit on the living room floor, fold the bulletin into three, seal it in an envelope and put the stamp on. We made about 1,000 of these every month.\n",
            "When Kaye and I were 12, we started working in the clinic as receptionists. We would take turns signing in patients, making them tea, developing X-rays and keeping them company until our dad was ready to see them.\n",
            "My parents treated us like adults who could be trusted, and their influence is evident in how I raised my children. From a young age, my kids helped me with my nutrition business. Tosca would go into my office and type up letters to doctors on a word processor. Elon was very good at helping to explain the word processor functions to me. Kimbal was always helpful, too.\n",
            "When we were living in Bloemfontein, I put Tosca to work at the modeling and image school I was running. Imagine an eight-year-old teaching students how to walk, choreographing runway shows and running etiquette classes. I even made her the dresser for all my shows.\n",
            "Let your kids decide what they want\n",
            "I brought my children up like my parents brought us up when we were young: to be independent, kind, honest, considerate and polite. I taught them them importance of working hard and doing good things. I didn’t treat them like babies or scold them. I never told them what to study. I didn’t check their homework; that was their responsibility.\n",
            "As they got older, they continued to take responsibility for their own futures through the decisions they made. Tosca chose her own high school. They all applied to their universities of choice and completed their scholarship and student loan applications.\n",
            "Children don’t need to be protected from the reality of responsibility. My kids benefited because they saw me work hard just to put a roof over our heads, put food in our stomachs and purchase secondhand clothes.\n",
            "1:30\n",
            "Elon Musk, Albert Einstein and Steve Jobs all have these traits in common\n",
            "When they went to college, they lived in quite poor conditions: mattress on the floor, six roommates or a dilapidated house. But they were fine with it. If your children aren’t used to luxuries, they survive well. You don’t need to spoil them. Once you’re sure your kids are in safe situations, let them look after themselves.\n",
            "So many parents get easily stressed about their kids. I saw it often in my nutrition practice. A father or mother would be stress eating because there were so many forms to fill out to get their kids into a good school or university.\n",
            "My advice? Let your kids handle their own documents to get themselves into universities or jobs. They should be responsible for their future. Or if they prefer to start a business and you think it’s a good idea, support them. Teach your children good manners. But let them decide what they want.\n",

The second of RD and Sooni’s 5 kids, Je-hangir spent his early days with his mother in France. He was educated in France, Japan and England be-fore being drafted into the French army for a mandatory one-year period.\n",

            "It was in the year 1923 that JRD lost his mother, who was just 43 then. The responsibility of the children fell on RD Tata. While Jehangir wanted to study engineering at Cambridge, his father decided to move him to England for a year to study grammar. However, fate had other plans.\n",
            "That year, the French government came up with a new rule—one year of compulsory military service for the eldest boy of each family. As a citizen of France, JRD had to enlist in the army.\n",
            "JRD’s acceptance in a cavalry unit\n",
            "By mid-1924, Jehangir was accepted into a cavalry unit which was an Algerian one. While he knew horse riding, the horses in JRD’s unit were pure Arab—fast and big, unlike the French. For a year, Jehangir trained dedicatedly and improved his riding skills which led to his selection for a promotion by mid-1925.\n",
            "He had to complete a special training course to get promoted, however, the idea was rejected by his father. \"Are you mad? Enough of sour army training,” RD wrote to him. Jehangir returned to India.\n",
            "The lucky coincidence!\n",
            "RD’s denial and JRD’s return to India turned out to be life-saver for the latter, literally.\n",
            "A few days after Jehangir left, his entire cavalry unit deployed in Morocco where each and every soldier was killed. The whole unit was wiped out by the bandit leader Abdul Kareem and his men.\n",
            "A few years after moving to India, JRD renounced his French citizenship in 1929 and decided to become an Indian citizen. He lived his and how! JRD created Air India, oversaw the Tata Group’s expansion and the rest is history.\n",

The LIC board on Saturday gave its nod to cut down the issue size to 3.5 per cent from 5 per cent.\n",
            "This means that the government will dilute only 3.5 per cent of its shares worth Rs 21,000 crore as compared to 5 per cent shares announced earlier. However, the decision is subject to regulatory approval, according to an official quoted by Business Standard.\n",
            "A proposal in this regard was presented before the board today.\n",
            "The reduction in the issue size now puts India’s largest insurer’s valuation at Rs 6 trillion, which has been finalised after taking feedback from investors. The latest valuation has been fixed at 1.1 times LIC’s embedded value of Rs 5.39 trillion.\n",
            "This would need Securities and Exchange Board of India’s permission as the market regulator states that companies having a valuation over Rs 1 trillion have to dilute 5 per cent equity and Rs 5,000 worth shares.\n",

            "New Delhi: After two years of Covid-19 pandemic, things finally seem to be getting back on track and even more so for freshers! How? Well, the answer is higher pay packages. Noida-based IT company HCL Technologies has hiked the salary package of freshers from the previous Rs 3.5 lakh per year to Rs 4.25 lakh per year.\n",
            "Along with this, the IT major also introduced comprehensive increment plans for the entry level during the previous fiscal year (FY22), according to their chief human resources officer VV Apparao.\n",
            "\"Wherever the skills are at a premium, we increase the grades. If you look at the fresher talent, today, we are paying Rs 4.25 lakh per annum to graduates now,\" Apparao told Economic Times. The company’s changes in salary package and appraisal plans are aimed at attracting more talent and combatting an acute attrition challenge.\n",
            "The wage hike could be announced in July.\n",
            "With a focus now set on retention and fresher growth through its system, it will take a few more quarters for HCL before the attrition rate recedes from the current 20 per cent levels. The country’s third largest software services provider by revenue is now also broadening its base in smaller cities and abroad to see its talent base balloon.\n",
            "HCL's plans for freshers\n",
            "As part of its plan to increase the fresher base, HCL is even talking to the educational institutions where they are selecting these kids and asking the educational institutions to make it a part of the curriculum so that they complete these and join at Rs 6 lakh per annum, Apparao shared.\n",
            "This hike in package in FY22 is in addition to HCL’s existing programme that lets freshers get additional certifications to increase their compensation to Rs 6 lakh a year.\n",
            "Meanwhile, HCL Tech reported an operating margin of 18 per cent for the quarter ended March 31 and 18.9 per cent for the full fiscal year, which were at the lower end of estimates due to higher employee costs and a seasonal dip in its products and platforms (P&P) business.\n",
            "Fresher hirings at HCL\n",
            "In FY22, the IT company exceeded its guidance for fresher hires (20,000-22,000) and welcomed 23,000 recruits. For the present year, HCL has predicted nearly 34,000 fresher recruits. Of the total employee base of 208,877, HCL’s fresher intake is about 11 per cent.\n",
            "This is much less than the fresher intakes of rivals like TCS and Infosys at 16 per cent and 27 208,877 fresher intake respectively, as a share of their overall employee base in FY22.\n",
            "\"Last year, we already rolled out increments, defined fresher compensation grids and corrected the same for the previous five batches. In addition, we also rolled out a couple of retention kitties. Hence, I don't see that there would be a need for anything more than what we have given as an increment last year because it was not a standalone increment,\" Apparao said.\n",

            "New Delhi: In a major setback for fintech companies expecting to get their payment aggregator licence, the Reserve Bank of India could reject their applications owing to the connection of some of these with cryptocurrency exchanges and gaming apps.\n",
            "Online payment companies including MobiKwik and Cashfree could face the RBI heat in the backdrop of some of these fintech firms’ dealings with crypto exchanges and gaming apps, Economic Times quoted a person aware of the development as saying.\n",
            "Bengaluru-based payment and banking technology company Cashfree Payments has undergone harsh questions regarding merchant partnerships for its payouts business, know-your-customer (KYC) norms, its net-worth criteria, and for onboarding betting apps as clients.\n",
            "However, a company spokesperson said that their payment aggregator licence application is under consideration by the RBI. “We decline to comment on baseless speculation,” they added.\n",
            "RBI not okay with fintechs' dealings with crypt companies\n",
            "The RBI is clearly not okay with payment aggregators having dealings with cryptocurrency companies, or with gaming apps which have in the past been accused of being a conduit to launder money, according to a person directly aware of the development.\n",
            "“The RBI does not appreciate payment providers powering the cryptocurrency industry in any shape or form, whether it is supporting the trading or providing their platform for any other use-cases. The RBI is also taking note of what KYC norms are being followed by these payment platforms, with the remotest risk identified leading to rejections. There is no scope of negotiation this time,” the person added.\n",
            "Moreover, the central bank has also decided to dismiss the payment aggregator licence of ZaakPay, the payment gateway service of MobiKwik, the reason again being its crypto partnerships and for failing to meet the laid-down net-worth criterion.\n",
            "What is the net-worth criterion?\n",
            "The RBI rules state that payment aggregators are required to show a net worth of Rs 15 crore on the date of their applications or as of March-end 2021, and of Rs 25 crore by the end of the ongoing fiscal year.\n",
            "Last year, it was reported that several Indian payment gateways were under the ED lens for letting customers transfer money to Chinese betting apps.\n",

            "New Delhi: RD Tata, a business partner and relative of Jamsetji Tata, and his French wife Sooni became parents to their second child, a boy, in Paris in 1904. The boy would later on grow up to make a name for himself while also giving India its very first airline - Air India!\n",
            "By now many would have guessed that this is the story of none other than JRD Tata, the man who touched the lives of rich and poor, manager and worker, alike. The second of RD and Sooni’s 5 kids, Je-hangir spent his early days with his mother in France. He was educated in France, Japan and England be-fore being drafted into the French army for a mandatory one-year period.\n",
            "JRD’s entry into the French Army\n",
            "It was in the year 1923 that JRD lost his mother, who was just 43 then. The responsibility of the children fell on RD Tata. While Jehangir wanted to study engineering at Cambridge, his father decided to move him to England for a year to study grammar. However, fate had other plans.\n",
            "That year, the French government came up with a new rule—one year of compulsory military service for the eldest boy of each family. As a citizen of France, JRD had to enlist in the army.\n",
            "JRD’s acceptance in a cavalry unit\n",
            "By mid-1924, Jehangir was accepted into a cavalry unit which was an Algerian one. While he knew horse riding, the horses in JRD’s unit were pure Arab—fast and big, unlike the French. For a year, Jehangir trained dedicatedly and improved his riding skills which led to his selection for a promotion by mid-1925.\n",
            "He had to complete a special training course to get promoted, however, the idea was rejected by his father. \"Are you mad? Enough of sour army training,” RD wrote to him. Jehangir returned to India.\n",
            "The lucky coincidence!\n",
            "RD’s denial and JRD’s return to India turned out to be life-saver for the latter, literally.\n",
            "A few days after Jehangir left, his entire cavalry unit deployed in Morocco where each and every soldier was killed. The whole unit was wiped out by the bandit leader Abdul Kareem and his men.\n",
            "A few years after moving to India, JRD renounced his French citizenship in 1929 and decided to become an Indian citizen. He lived his and how! JRD created Air India, oversaw the Tata Group’s expansion and the rest is history.\n",

The LIC board on Saturday gave its nod to cut down the issue size to 3.5 per cent from 5 per cent.\n",

            "Along with this, the IT major also introduced comprehensive increment plans for the entry level during the previous fiscal year (FY22), according to their chief human resources officer VV Apparao.\n",
            "\"Wherever the skills are at a premium, we increase the grades. If you look at the fresher talent, today, we are paying Rs 4.25 lakh per annum to graduates now,\" Apparao told Economic Times. The company’s changes in salary package and appraisal plans are aimed at attracting more talent and combatting an acute attrition challenge.\n",
            "The wage hike could be announced in July.\n",
            "With a focus now set on retention and fresher growth through its system, it will take a few more quarters for HCL before the attrition rate recedes from the current 20 per cent levels. The country’s third largest software services provider by revenue is now also broadening its base in smaller cities and abroad to see its talent base balloon.\n",
            "HCL's plans for freshers\n",
            "As part of its plan to increase the fresher base, HCL is even talking to the educational institutions where they are selecting these kids and asking the educational institutions to make it a part of the curriculum so that they complete these and join at Rs 6 lakh per annum, Apparao shared.\n",
            "This hike in package in FY22 is in addition to HCL’s existing programme that lets freshers get additional certifications to increase their compensation to Rs 6 lakh a year.\n",
            "Meanwhile, HCL Tech reported an operating margin of 18 per cent for the quarter ended March 31 and 18.9 per cent for the full fiscal year, which were at the lower end of estimates due to higher employee costs and a seasonal dip in its products and platforms (P&P) business.\n",
            "Fresher hirings at HCL\n",
            "In FY22, the IT company exceeded its guidance for fresher hires (20,000-22,000) and welcomed 23,000 recruits. For the present year, HCL has predicted nearly 34,000 fresher recruits. Of the total employee base of 208,877, HCL’s fresher intake is about 11 per cent.\n",
            "This is much less than the fresher intakes of rivals like TCS and Infosys at 16 per cent and 27 208,877 fresher intake respectively, as a share of their overall employee base in FY22.\n",
            "\"Last year, we already rolled out increments, defined fresher compensation grids and corrected the same for the previous five batches. In addition, we also rolled out a couple of retention kitties. Hence, I don't see that there would be a need for anything more than what we have given as an increment last year because it was not a standalone increment,\" Apparao said.\n",

            "New Delhi: In a major setback for fintech companies expecting to get their payment aggregator licence, the Reserve Bank of India could reject their applications owing to the connection of some of these with cryptocurrency exchanges and gaming apps.\n",
            "Online payment companies including MobiKwik and Cashfree could face the RBI heat in the backdrop of some of these fintech firms’ dealings with crypto exchanges and gaming apps, Economic Times quoted a person aware of the development as saying.\n",
            "Bengaluru-based payment and banking technology company Cashfree Payments has undergone harsh questions regarding merchant partnerships for its payouts business, know-your-customer (KYC) norms, its net-worth criteria, and for onboarding betting apps as clients.\n",
            "However, a company spokesperson said that their payment aggregator licence application is under consideration by the RBI. “We decline to comment on baseless speculation,” they added.\n",
            "RBI not okay with fintechs' dealings with crypt companies\n",
            "The RBI is clearly not okay with payment aggregators having dealings with cryptocurrency companies, or with gaming apps which have in the past been accused of being a conduit to launder money, according to a person directly aware of the development.\n",
            "“The RBI does not appreciate payment providers powering the cryptocurrency industry in any shape or form, whether it is supporting the trading or providing their platform for any other use-cases. The RBI is also taking note of what KYC norms are being followed by these payment platforms, with the remotest risk identified leading to rejections. There is no scope of negotiation this time,” the person added.\n",
            "Moreover, the central bank has also decided to dismiss the payment aggregator licence of ZaakPay, the payment gateway service of MobiKwik, the reason again being its crypto partnerships and for failing to meet the laid-down net-worth criterion.\n",
            "What is the net-worth criterion?\n",
            "The RBI rules state that payment aggregators are required to show a net worth of Rs 15 crore on the date of their applications or as of March-end 2021, and of Rs 25 crore by the end of the ongoing fiscal year.\n",

            "According to CNBC, billionaire Elon Musk has offered a seriously heavy bag to buy Twitter. The mogul is requesting to purchase the bluebird app for $54.20 a share as noted in a filing published this past Thursday. His motive? Musk believes that the company needs to be privatized immediately: \"I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy,\" he shared in a letter to Bret Taylor, Twitter's official Chairman. Elon Musk, who requested the services of financial advisor Morgan Stanley to stake his claim, goes on to add that the social media company must go private to allow full freedom of speech which, in his observations, cannot be done in its current state. \n",
            "Christian Marquardt - Pool/Getty Images\n",
            "“As a result, I am offering to buy 100% of Twitter for $54.20 per share in cash, a 54% premium over the day before I began investing in Twitter and a 38% premium over the day before my investment was publicly announced,” he noted in his letter to Bret Taylor. “My offer is my best and final offer and if it is not accepted, I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder.” Evidently, Musk has big ideas, but will Twitter's head honchos take him up on his offer? We expect more news on this in the future. \n",

            "Krishnagiri: Bhavish Aggarwal will not invite Elon Musk to his state-of-the-art, electric two-wheeler manufacturing facility here as the Ola Founder and CEO feels that when India becomes a global hub for electrification, Tesla CEO will have no choice but to come to the country.\n",
            "Aggarwal said that not one company has the right or the entitlement to own the future of humanity, which is electric mobility.\n",
            "“Why should I invite Musk? It is he who should invite us as we have to take pride in our work,” Aggarwal told IANS.\n",
            "“On one company can bring true mobility to the world. Neither Tesla, nor Ola. Our focus is on empowering our communities and building electrification for India and for the world, and genuinely creating the future industry right here,” he emphasised.\n",
            "Aggarwal, who revealed that Ola Electric has started testing an autonomous vehicle which it will launch in the global market by late 2023 or early 2024, said that the goal is to really make India a global hub for electrification.\n",
            "“Once we achieve that, Musk will come on his own,” he told IANS.\n",
            "Despite tall promises and a lot of dilly-dallying, Tesla is yet to arrive in India amid “challenges with the government”, especially around high customs duties and a key demand to manufacture its cars in the country.\n",
            "Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari recently said that manufacturing Tesla in China and selling in India is not a digestible concept to “all of us”, as Musk continues to seek tax rebates to sell his electric car in the country.\n",
            "“If you start here, you are welcome, no problem. But manufacturing in China and selling in India is not a digestible concept to all of us,” he had said.\n",
            "Gadkari said that the country cannot appease one automobile company.\n",
            "“India is a huge market. We have all the world’s automobile giants — BMW, Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, Tototo, Honda, Hyundai — present here. If we give one benefit to one company, we have to give that benefit to other companies also. That is the practical problem,” he elaborated.\n",

            "Takeovers are usually friendly affairs. Corporate executives engage in top-secret talks, with one company or group of investors making a bid for another business. After some negotiating, the companies engaged in the merger or acquisition announce a deal has been struck.\n",

            "Companies have various measures in their arsenal to ward off such unwanted advances. One of the most effective antitakeover measures is the shareholder rights plan, also more aptly known as a “poison pill.” It is designed to block an investor from accumulating a majority stake in a company.\n",
            "Advertisement\n",
            "Twitter adopted a poison pill plan on April 15, shortly after Musk unveiled his takeover offer in a Securities and Exchange filing.\n",
            "I’m a scholar of corporate finance. Let me explain why poison pills have been effective at warding off unsolicited offers, at least until now.\n",
            "What’s a poison pill?\n",
            "Poison pills were developed in the early 1980s as a defense tactic against corporate raiders to effectively poison their takeover efforts—sort of reminiscent of the suicide pills that spies supposedly swallow if captured.\n",
            "There are many variants of poison pills, but they generally increase the number of shares, which then dilutes the bidder’s stake and causes them a significant financial loss.\n",
            "Let’s say a company has 1,000 shares outstanding valued at $10 each, which means the company has a market value of $10,000. An activist investor purchases 100 shares at the cost of $1,000 and accumulates a significant 10% stake in the company. But if the company has a poison pill that is triggered once any hostile bidder owns 10% of its stock, all other shareholders would suddenly have the opportunity to buy additional shares at a discounted price—say, half the market price. This has the effect of quickly diluting the activist investor’s original stake and also making it worth a lot less than it was before.\n",
            "Twitter adopted a similar measure. If any shareholder accumulates a 15% stake in the company in a purchase not approved by the board of directors, other shareholders would get the right to buy additional shares at a discount, diluting the 9.2% stake Musk recently purchased.\n",
            "Poison pills are useful in part because they can be adopted quickly, but they usually have expiration dates. The poison pill adopted by Twitter, for example, expires in one year.\n",

            "LAST CHANCE: 50% OFF 1 YEAR\n",
            "A successful tactic\n",
            "Many well-known companies such as Papa John’s PZZA, -3.67%,  Netflix NFLX, -1.24%,  JCPenney and Avis Budget Group CAR, -3.48%  have used poison pills to successfully fend off hostile takeovers. And nearly 100 companies adopted poison pills in 2020 because they were worried that their careening stock prices, caused by the pandemic market swoon, would make them vulnerable to hostile takeovers.\n",
            "Advertisement\n",
            "No one has ever triggered—or swallowed—a poison pill that was designed to fend off an unsolicited takeover offer, showing how effective such measures are at fending off takeover attempts.\n",
            "These types of antitakeover measures are generally frowned upon as a poor corporate governance practice that can hurt a company’s value and performance. They can be seen as impediments to the ability of shareholders and outsiders to monitor management, and more about protecting the board and management than attracting more generous offers from potential buyers.\n",
            "However, shareholders may benefit from poison pills if they lead to a higher bid for the company, for example. This may be already happening with Twitter as another bidder—a $103 billion private-equity firm—may have surfaced.\n",
            "A poison pill isn’t foolproof, however. A bidder facing a poison pill could try to argue that the board is not acting in the best interests of shareholders and appeal directly to them through either a tender offer—buying shares directly from other shareholders at a premium in a public bid—or a proxy contest, which involves convincing enough fellow shareholders to join a vote to oust some or all of the existing board.\n",
            "And judging by his tweets to his 82 million Twitter followers, that seems to be what Musk is doing.\n",

            "Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk earned the nickname “Teflon Elon” by successfully fighting off multiple legal challenges. But a recent court ruling suggests his run of personal victories may be endangered.\n",
            "Last week, it was revealed that a San Francisco judge had determined that one of Musk’s 2018 tweets about taking his company private was a lie.\n",
            "It’s one of at least a dozen high-profile cases that Tesla or Musk are involved in years after he posted the infamous “funding secured” tweet, sending shares soaring and inviting the wrath of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n",
            "Now, as Musk ramps up his battle to buy Twitter Inc., the lingering ramifications of his prior use of the social media platform may come back to haunt him.\n",
            "The judge’s decision tips the scales heavily in favor of Tesla investors who are suing Musk and Tesla for as much as $12 billion in trading losses they blame on the go-private tweets. That case is set for a jury trial in January.\n",
            "The decision also poses a threat to Musk’s effort to unleash himself from oversight by the SEC — a quest so personal for the world’s richest person that he became visibly emotional while lambasting the agency during a TED talk in Canada last week.\n",
            "Securities law experts including Columbia Law School professor Jeffrey Gordon say that being ruled a liar after years of insisting his tweets were truthful will make it harder for the voluble billionaire to wriggle out from underneath the “Twitter Sitter” — the moniker for the arrangement with the SEC that a Tesla official preapprove what Musk says on social media about certain company-related topics, like production.\n",
            "Musk said in a sworn statement in New York federal court last month that he “never lied to shareholders.”\n",
            "That was before U.S. District Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco issued his ruling, which remains sealed from public view.\n",
            "Musk is trying to appeal the finding, saying in a filing Friday that the judge “parsed the individual phrases of the various tweets and indicated certain other information should have accompanied the tweets, even though the short-form Twitter medium limits the number of characters per tweet.”\n",
            "Musk’s lawyer, Alex Spiro, didn’t respond to a request for comment on the SEC fight, which is ongoing in New York. But his response to Chen’s ruling on April 16 was defiant.\n",
            "“Nothing will ever change the truth, which is that Elon Musk was considering taking Tesla private and could have,” the attorney said.\n",
            "Gordon said the Tesla CEO isn’t helping himself by continuing to defend the tweet.\n",
            "“Musk’s subsequent denialism in the face of Judge Chen’s ruling will further weaken his case against the SEC,” he said.\n",
            "Not all securities experts agreed Chen’s ruling was so potentially damaging. James D. Cox, a professor at Duke Law School, said the SEC faces an uphill fight trying to apply a ruling from a San Francisco lawsuit to a New York case involving different parties.\n",
            "Going forward, the challenge facing the SEC is how to regulate high-profile public figures like Musk with millions of Twitter followers, with these VIPs knowing the potential impact of their statements on capital markets, said Jill E. Fisch, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School.\n",
            "“Musk is the current and most visible example of this,” Fisch said. “He’s not likely to be the only one.”\n",
            "The SEC declined to comment.\n",
            "As for Musk’s other legal woes, he’s awaiting a ruling any day following a $13 billion trial in Delaware over his role in the electric carmaker’s 2016 buyout of SolarCity.\n",
            "In the San Francisco case, Bloomberg Intelligence estimated before Chen issued his ruling that the lawsuit could settle for between $260 million and $380 million.\n",
            "“The price of settlement just went way up,” said Adam C. Pritchard, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School. Chen’s ruling was a “huge win” for shareholders and an appeal of the decision by Musk “might be hard to come by,” he said.\n",
            "Nicholas Porritt, a lawyer representing shareholders, said he expects Chen’s ruling will become public in the next few days.\n",
            "Chen’s decision means that Musk won’t be able to argue to jurors that some key statements in his tweets were true, or that he didn’t act fraudulently when he made them, Porritt said.\n",
            "A pretrial ruling that so thoroughly discredits a defendant in a securities fraud case is “very rare,” Porritt said. “Certainly it has not been obtained in any case of similar size to this one.”\n",

            "Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk earned the nickname “Teflon Elon” by successfully fighting off multiple legal challenges. But a recent court ruling suggests his run of personal victories may be endangered.\n",
            "Last week, it was revealed that a San Francisco judge had determined that one of Musk’s 2018 tweets about taking his company private was a lie.\n",
            "It’s one of at least a dozen high-profile cases that Tesla or Musk are involved in years after he posted the infamous “funding secured” tweet, sending shares soaring and inviting the wrath of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n",
            "Now, as Musk ramps up his battle to buy Twitter Inc., the lingering ramifications of his prior use of the social media platform may come back to haunt him.\n",
            "The judge’s decision tips the scales heavily in favor of Tesla investors who are suing Musk and Tesla for as much as $12 billion in trading losses they blame on the go-private tweets. That case is set for a jury trial in January.\n",
            "The decision also poses a threat to Musk’s effort to unleash himself from oversight by the SEC — a quest so personal for the world’s richest person that he became visibly emotional while lambasting the agency during a TED talk in Canada last week.\n",
            "Securities law experts including Columbia Law School professor Jeffrey Gordon say that being ruled a liar after years of insisting his tweets were truthful will make it harder for the voluble billionaire to wriggle out from underneath the “Twitter Sitter” — the moniker for the arrangement with the SEC that a Tesla official preapprove what Musk says on social media about certain company-related topics, like production.\n",
            "Musk said in a sworn statement in New York federal court last month that he “never lied to shareholders.”\n",
            "That was before U.S. District Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco issued his ruling, which remains sealed from public view.\n",
            "Musk is trying to appeal the finding, saying in a filing Friday that the judge “parsed the individual phrases of the various tweets and indicated certain other information should have accompanied the tweets, even though the short-form Twitter medium limits the number of characters per tweet.”\n",
            "Musk’s lawyer, Alex Spiro, didn’t respond to a request for comment on the SEC fight, which is ongoing in New York. But his response to Chen’s ruling on April 16 was defiant.\n",
            "“Nothing will ever change the truth, which is that Elon Musk was considering taking Tesla private and could have,” the attorney said.\n",
            "Gordon said the Tesla CEO isn’t helping himself by continuing to defend the tweet.\n",
            "“Musk’s subsequent denialism in the face of Judge Chen’s ruling will further weaken his case against the SEC,” he said.\n",
            "Not all securities experts agreed Chen’s ruling was so potentially damaging. James D. Cox, a professor at Duke Law School, said the SEC faces an uphill fight trying to apply a ruling from a San Francisco lawsuit to a New York case involving different parties.\n",
            "Going forward, the challenge facing the SEC is how to regulate high-profile public figures like Musk with millions of Twitter followers, with these VIPs knowing the potential impact of their statements on capital markets, said Jill E. Fisch, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School.\n",
            "“Musk is the current and most visible example of this,” Fisch said. “He’s not likely to be the only one.”\n",
            "The SEC declined to comment.\n",
            "As for Musk’s other legal woes, he’s awaiting a ruling any day following a $13 billion trial in Delaware over his role in the electric carmaker’s 2016 buyout of SolarCity.\n",
            "In the San Francisco case, Bloomberg Intelligence estimated before Chen issued his ruling that the lawsuit could settle for between $260 million and $380 million.\n",
            "“The price of settlement just went way up,” said Adam C. Pritchard, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School. Chen’s ruling was a “huge win” for shareholders and an appeal of the decision by Musk “might be hard to come by,” he said.\n",
            "Nicholas Porritt, a lawyer representing shareholders, said he expects Chen’s ruling will become public in the next few days.\n",
            "Chen’s decision means that Musk won’t be able to argue to jurors that some key statements in his tweets were true, or that he didn’t act fraudulently when he made them, Porritt said.\n",
            "A pretrial ruling that so thoroughly discredits a defendant in a securities fraud case is “very rare,” Porritt said. “Certainly it has not been obtained in any case of similar size to this one.”\n",

            "New York (CNN Business)Does the richest person on the planet need another massive pay package? That's the decision facing the Tesla board of directors.\n",
            "CEO Elon Musk doesn't receive any cash salary or bonus. He's paid only with stock options. But he has just about exhausted the options available from the compensation package he got from Tesla in 2018, a package that turned out to be the most lucrative package of stock options issued by any company, according to Courtney Yu, director of research at executive compensation firm Equilar.\n",
            "The 93.9 million options Musk has received so far from that package were worth $86.8 billion as of Friday's close, after taking into account the exercise price.\n",
            "Musk got 25.3 million of those options just this past week due to the record earnings Tesla posted Wednesday. He's likely to soon receive another 8.4 million options, probably after the company posts its second or third-quarter results, based on analysts' revenue forecasts for the company.\n",
            "But those 8.4 million options, worth billions, are a relatively small portion of what Musk ultimately might receive. Once he gets those additional options, he will have received all 101 million split-adjusted options that were part of that 2018 pay package. The question should be whether he'll get even more options, perhaps tens of millions more options.\n",
            "Musk dodged a question about such a payday during an investor call Wednesday, saying simply, \"There are no discussions currently underway for incremental compensation for me.\"\n",

            "Not all tech CEO get options\n",
            "Some tech billionaires have done just fine without stock options.\n",
            "Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, who is the world's second-richest person, (worth about $100 billion less than Musk, and Facebook (FB) founder Mark Zuckerberg have received no stock grants or options since their companies' initial public offerings in 1997 and 2012, respectively. They also have not earned much in the way of salary. Bezos got $81,000 a year in salary while he was CEO and Zuckerberg has taken home a salary of $1 a year for most of the last decade.\n",
            "They profited from the vast appreciation in value of the shares they have held since their companies went public.\n",
            "Much of Musk's net worth, estimated at $270 billion, comes from the appreciation in Tesla shares. But he has also regularly received stock options as a form of compensation since 2009, the year before the company's IPO.\n",
            "He has exercised many of those options as they were due to expire. Virtually all his remaining options come from his 2018 pay package.\n",
            "Wall Street wants more Musk options\n",
            "Many analysts believe it's only a matter of time before Tesla comes up with another package of options for Musk.\n",
            "Alex Potter, the analyst for Piper Sandler & Co. who asked Musk about a possible new compensation package on Wednesday's investor call, took a moment to say that the previous package \"seemed to work quite well.\"\n",
            "And 81% of Tesla shareholders who voted on Musk's pay package in 2018 approved of it. Other analysts believe a new package will be good for the company, as well as Musk.\n",
            "\"Eventually the board will reload Elon's plan. And that plan will be massive, just like the last plan,\" said Gene Munster, managing partner at Loup Ventures. \"Elon thinks big, and he has massive new markets to go after and build large businesses including autonomy and robots.\"\n",
            "Is there a public relations downside to lavishing the world's richest person with additional options that could add tens, if not hundreds of billions, to his wealth?\n",
            "\"Elon is the richest person in the world, and he still can appeal to hardworking people,\" Munsger said. \"Those people would largely cheer him on with a massive new comp package.\"\n",
            "A new options package for Musk could do much to assure investors worried that he might lose his focus on Tesla due to his CEO position with SpaceX or his interest in buying and transforming Twitter.\n",
            "\"It will make Tesla investors sleep better at night knowing he has a five- to 10-year comp package signed, sealed and delivered,\" said Dan Ives, tech analyst with Wedbush Securities.\n",
            "Does Musk need more options to care about Tesla?\n",
            "It's tough to picture someone as wealthy as Musk, and as passionate as he is about Tesla, being motivated to spend more or less time on the company based on what he gets in his next compensation package. And if money is a motivating factor, the value of his current 265.5 million Tesla shares and options should provide all the incentive he needs.\n",
            "\"He's already financially motivated for Tesla to continue to do well,\" said Equilar's Yu.\n",
            "But advocates of a new package say it would answer many of the doubts about Musk's focus that have been swirling since he announced his plans to buy Twitter (TWTR).\n",
            "\"Even though his DNA is not going to change whether or not he has new Tesla options, the street is going to want him to have another comp package,\" said Ives.\n",
            "There are costs to Tesla involved in giving Musk additional options, even though it's non-cash compensation. The estimated accounting value of those options shows up as an expense in its earnings statement. Last year, Tesla booked $571 million in expenses related to Musk's 2018 pay package alone. If he doesn't get a new one, that expense will disappear from its profit and loss statement.\n",
            "Why Tesla investors may need to worry about Elon Musk's Twitter distraction\n",
            "And while a new package for Musk is sure to be criticized by those who believe executives are paid too much, Tesla shareholders, and no one else, will be making that decision.\n",
            "\"Musk is already either a hero or villain in eyes of people,\" said Ives. \"A new package is either going to cause people to hate him more, or be relieved he's staying put.\"\n",

            "Elon Musk, qui exprime régulièrement son attachement à la liberté d’expression, est vent debout contre ce qu’il qualifie de « virus woke ». Un des derniers exemples en date remonte au 19 avril dernier. Ce jour-là, sur Twitter, Netflix a annoncé avoir perdu des abonnés pour la première fois depuis dix ans. Dans le détail, l’action a chuté de 20 %. Et sous un tweet du média Slashdot, Elon Musk a évoqué ce qui, selon lui, pourrait expliquer la situation. « Le virus woke rend Netflix irregardable », a estimé le fondateur de Tesla et SpaceX, comme le rapporte Konbini, qui a repéré le tweet.  \n",

Ainsi, à l’hiver dernier, il avait déjà fustigé « un virus de l’esprit », à l’occasion d’un entretien accordé à Babylon Bee et mis en ligne sur YouTube. Celui qui avait été désigné personnalité de l’année 2021 par le magazine Time avait notamment avancé qu’« en son cœur, l’idéologie woke est source de divisions, d’exclusion et de haine. Le virus woke est sans doute l’une des plus grandes menaces pour la civilisation moderne. » \n",

We have all the world's automobile giants -- BMW, Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, Tototo, Honda, Hyundai -- present here. If we give one benefit to one company, we have to give that benefit to other companies also. That is the practical problem,\" he elaborated.\n",

Un des derniers exemples en date remonte au 19 avril dernier. Ce jour-là, sur Twitter, Netflix a annoncé avoir perdu des abonnés pour la première fois depuis dix ans. Dans le détail, l’action a chuté de 20 %. Et sous un tweet du média Slashdot, Elon Musk a évoqué ce qui, selon lui, pourrait expliquer la situation. « Le virus woke rend Netflix irregardable », a estimé le fondateur de Tesla et SpaceX, comme le rapporte Konbini, qui a repéré le tweet.  \n",

Ainsi, à l’hiver dernier, il avait déjà fustigé « un virus de l’esprit », à l’occasion d’un entretien accordé à Babylon Bee et mis en ligne sur YouTube. Celui qui avait été désigné personnalité de l’année 2021 par le magazine Time avait notamment avancé qu’« en son cœur, l’idéologie woke est source de divisions, d’exclusion et de haine. Le virus woke est sans doute l’une des plus grandes menaces pour la civilisation moderne. » \n",

            "Musk has also previously speculated on the possibility of Gates shorting his company’s stock. Asked about those comments and whether he was short Tesla, Gates told CNBC last year: “I don’t talk about my investments but I think he should be very proud of what he’s done.”\n",

            "lon Musk has now put together a $46.5bn financing package to buy Twitter – two thirds of it from his own assets, and a third from bank loans secured against Twitter’s assets. It’s the biggest acquisition financing ever put forward for one person.\n",

            "Twitter’s founder and top managers don’t want Musk to take over the company. They offered him a seat on the board but he didn’t want it because he’d have to be responsible to all other shareholders. Now they’re adopting a “poison pill” to stop him. But Musk plans to buy shares directly with a tender offer that shareholders can’t refuse. After all, it’s a free market.\n",
            "Musk says no one should object to what he wants to do with Twitter because he’s a “free speech absolutist,” and who can be against free speech? Besides, he and his apologists say, if consumers don’t like what he does with Twitter they can go elsewhere. Freedom to choose.\n",
            "Free market? Free speech? Free choice?\n",
            "When billionaires like Musk justify their motives by using “freedom,” beware. What they actually seek is freedom from accountability. They want to use their vast fortunes to do whatever they please – unconstrained by laws or regulations, shareholders, or even consumers.\n",
            "The “free market” increasingly reflects the demands of big money. Unfriendly takeovers, such as Musk is mounting at Twitter, weren’t part of the “free market” until the late 1970s and early 1980s. Before then, laws and regulations constrained them. Then came corporate raiders like Carl Icahn and Michael Milken. Their MO was to find corporations whose assets were worth more than their stock value, borrow against them, acquire enough shares to force them to cut costs (such as laying off workers, abandoning their communities, busting unions, and taking on crushing debt), and cash in.\n",
            "But the raiders’ antics often imposed huge social costs. They pushed America from stakeholder capitalism (where workers and communities had a say in what corporations did) to shareholder capitalism (where the sole corporate goal is to maximize shareholder value). Inequality skyrocketed, insecurity soared, vast swaths of America were abandoned, and millions of good jobs vanished.\n",
            "The raiders altered the “free market” to allow them to do this. That’s what the super-rich do. There’s no “free market” in nature. The “free market” depends on laws and rules. If you have enough money, you can buy changes in those laws and rules that make you even more money. (You can also get the government to subsidize you – Musk has received a reported $4.9bn so far.)\n",
            "“Free speech” is another freedom that turns on wealth. As a practical matter, your ability to be heard turns on the size of the megaphone you can buy. If you’re extremely rich you can purchase the Washington Post or own Fox News. If you’re the wealthiest person in the world you can buy one of the biggest megaphones in the world called Twitter – and then decide who can use it, what its algorithms are going to be, and how it either invites or filters out big lies.\n",
            "Musk said last week that he doesn’t care about the economics of the deal and is pursuing it because it is “extremely important to the future of civilization.” Fine, but who anointed Musk to decide the future of civilization?\n",
            "Which brings us to free choice. If consumers don’t like what Musk does with Twitter, they cannot simply switch to another Twitter-like platform. There aren’t any. The largest social media platforms have grown gigantic because anyone who wants to participate in them and influence debate has to join them. After they reach a certain size, they’re the only megaphone in town. Where else would consumers go to post short messages that can reach tens of millions of people other than Twitter?\n",
            "With social media, the ordinary rules of competition don’t apply. Once a platform is dominant it becomes even more dominant. As Donald Trump discovered with his “Truth Social” fiasco, upstarts don’t stand much chance.\n",
            "Musk’s real goal has nothing to do with the freedom of others. His goal is his own unconstrained freedom – the freedom to wield enormous power without having to be accountable to laws and regulations, to shareholders, or to market competition – which is why he’s dead set on owning Twitter.\n",
            "Unlike his ambitions to upend transportation and interstellar flight, this one is dangerous. It might well upend democracy.\n",
            "Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and the author of Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few and The Common Good. His new book, The System: Who Rigged It, How We Fix It, is out now. He is a Guardian US columnist. His newsletter is at robertreich.substack.com\n",

            "Crypto billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried has said he would be \"excited\" to be involved in Elon Musk's push to transform Twitter.\n",
            "The FTX CEO told Bloomberg that he hasn't spoken to Musk about his plans to take over the social network, but firmly believes that blockchain technology could play an instrumental role in preserving free speech. He said:\n",
            "\"Maybe as a test case first, I'd be excited to help on the designing and building of it… and potentially helping to manage a network that was looking to do this.\"\n",
            "SBF argues that the fragmented nature of social networks is a big problem — with major platforms operating in silos. He explained:\n",
            "\"There's no ability to see a tweet on Facebook. If you message someone on Facebook, even WhatsApp can't read it — and that's the same company. It's this really messy system where there's no interoperability between different platforms.\"\n",
            "The crypto exchange founder also took aim at the failure of social networks to deliver moderation that navigates the fine line between free speech and censorship — and claimed \"three guys who run three companies\" have basically been tasked with deciding what can and can't be said.\n",
            "\"We've seen that that is a broken model, right? We saw social media choose not to censor misinformation in 2016 and get absolutely roasted for that decision. And then we saw them choose to censor in 2020 and get roasted for that decision.\"\n",
            "Listen to the CoinMarketRecap podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify and Google Podcasts\n",
            "Is Blockchain the Answer?\n",
            "According to Bankman-Fried, blockchain technology could help solve some of the problems that exist with social networks today.\n",
            "Posts would be placed on one network — meaning any social network, be it Facebook or Twitter, could access these messages.\n",
            "SBF argued that this would allow for greater levels of competition — and level the playing field by allowing smaller platforms to flourish. He also claimed this would allow social networks to take differing approaches to moderation, giving choice to consumers.\n",
            "It's fair to say that SBF's vision is substantially more radical than Musk's — not least because it would potentially involve dragging Facebook into the equation.\n",
            "The debate over Twitter's future following Musk's shock bid to take over the company has attracted many heavyweights in the crypto world. Tron's founder Justin Sun has even offered to pay more for Twitter than Tesla's CEO. Meanwhile, Cardano's Charles Hoskinson has offered to build a decentralized version of Twitter if the company ends up rejecting Musk's proposal — something that seems likely given how the tech giant has embraced a \"poison pill\" strategy to make any hostile takeover harder.\n",
            "Musk's flood of tweets regarding the Twitter have slowed to a trickle in recent days, but he did post this on Tuesday:\n",
            "\"A social media platform’s policies are good if the most extreme 10% on left and right are equally unhappy.\"\n",
            "Users — and shareholders — are now nervously waiting to see what happens next in the fast-moving drama between Musk and Twitter. The company's stock fell by 4.73% in trading on Tuesday as the uncertainty rumbles on.\n",

            "In mid-April, Elon Musk made public his desire to acquire Twitter, make it a private company, and overhaul its moderation policies. Citing ideals of free speech, Musk claimed that “Twitter has become kind of the de facto town square, so it’s just really important that people have the, both the reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law.”\n",
            "While making Twitter free for all “within the bounds of the law” seems like a way to ensure free speech in theory, in practice, this action would actually serve to suppress the speech of Twitter’s most vulnerable users.\n",

            "Withdrawal responses\n",
            "In various research projects since 2018, we have interviewed scholars who have experienced online harassment, surveyed academics about their experiences with harassment, conducted in-depth reviews of literature detailing how knowledge workers experience online harassment, and reached out to institutions that employ knowledge workers who experience online harassment.\n",
            "Overwhelmingly, throughout our various projects, we’ve noticed some common themes:\n",
            "– Individuals are targeted for online harassment on platforms like Twitter simply because they are women or members of a minority group (racialized, gender non-conforming, disabled or otherwise marginalized). The topics people post about matter less than their identities in predicting the intensity of online harassment people are subjected to.\n",

            "– Men who experience online harassment, often experience a different type of harassment than women or marginalized people. Women, for example, tend to experience more sexualized harassment, such as rape threats.\n",
            "– When people experience harassment, they seek support from their organizations, social media platforms and law enforcement, but often find the support they receive is insufficient.\n",
            "– When people do not receive adequate support from their organizations, social media platforms and law enforcement, they adopt strategies to protect themselves, including withdrawing from social media.\n",
            "This last point is important, because our data shows that there is a very real risk of losing ideas in the unmoderated Twitter space that Musk says he wants to build in the name of free speech.\n",

            "Or in other words, what Musk is proposing would likely make speech on Twitter less free than it is now, because people who cannot rely on social media platforms to protect them from online harassment tend to leave the platform when the consequences of online harassment become psychologically or socially destructive.\n",
            "Arenas for debate\n",
            "Political economist John Stuart Mill famously wrote about the marketplace of ideas, suggesting that in an environment where ideas can be debated, the best ones will rise to the top. This is often used to justify opinions that social media platforms like Twitter should do away with moderation in order to encourage constructive debate.\n",
            "This implies that bad ideas should be taken care of by a sort of invisible hand, in which people will only share and engage with the best content on Twitter, and the toxic content will be a small price to pay for a thriving online public sphere.\n",

            "The assumption that good ideas would edge out the bad ones is both counter to Mill’s original writing, and the actual lived experience of posting to social media for people in minority groups.\n",
            "Mill advocated that minority ideas be given artificial preference in order to encourage constructive debate on a wide range of topics in the public interest. Importantly, this means that moderation of online harassment is key to a functioning marketplace of ideas.\n",
            "Regulation of harassment\n",
            "The idea that we need some sort of online regulation of harassing speech is borne out by our research. Our research participants repeatedly told us that the consequences of online harassment were extremely damaging. These consequences ranged from burnout or inability to complete their work, to emotional and psychological trauma, or even social isolation.\n",

            "When targets of harassment experienced these outcomes, they often also experienced economic impacts, such as issues with career progression after being unable to complete work. Many of our participants tried reporting the harassment to social media platforms. If the support they received from the platform was dismissive or unhelpful, they felt less likely to engage in the future.\n",
            "When people disengage from Twitter due to widespread harassment, we lose those voices from the very online public sphere that Musk says he wants to foster. In practice, this means that women and marginalized groups are most likely to be the people who are excluded from Musk’s free speech playground.\n",
            "Given that our research participants have told us that they already feel Twitter’s approach to online harassment is limited at best, I would suggest that if we really want a marketplace of ideas on Twitter, we need more moderation, not less. For this reason, I’m happy that the Twitter Board of Directors is attempting to resist Musk’s hostile takeover.\n",

            "The world's richest man also doesn't own yachts or take vacations but has a plane to save time.\n",

            "The world's richest man said that he doesn't own a home and crashes on friends' couches.\n",
            "\"I don't even own a place right now, I'm literally staying at friends' places,\" Elon Musk said in a video interview with Chris Anderson, head of conference organizers TED, published Monday.\n",
            "\"If I travel to the Bay Area, which is where most of Tesla's engineering is, I basically rotate through friends' spare bedrooms,\" Musk added. \n",
            "Musk, who has an estimated\n",
            "net worth\n",
            "of $251 billion, according to Bloomberg, was responding to Anderson's comment that many are offended by the concept of billionaires, given global disparities in wealth. US lawmakers, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have also criticized megabillionaires like Musk for their comparatively low tax bills.\n",
            "\"For sure, it would be very problematic if I was spending billions of dollars a year in personal consumption, but that is not the case,\" Musk told Anderson, adding that he doesn't own a yacht or really take vacations, though he famously does have a personal jet. \n",
            "\"It's not as though my personal consumption is high. I mean, the one exception is the plane, but if I don't use the plane then I have less hours to work,\" he said, acknowledging that his net wealth was nonetheless \"bonkers.\" \n",
            "Musk's comments look like his first confirmation that he doesn't have a permanent home, despite being the world's richest person. \n",
            "The billionaire's friends have commented over the years on his thrifty habits. \n",
            "In May 2020, he tweeted his intention to sell all his possessions and that he would \"own no house.\" In August 2021, Insider reported that Musk was thought to be living in a $50,000 prefab tiny home, which he rents from SpaceX.\n",
            "In a recent interview with Vanity Fair, Musk's on-again, off-again partner Grimes said he sometimes lived \"below the poverty line.\" He refused to buy a new mattress after her side had a hole in it, she said.\n",
            "And in 2015, Google's cofounder and then-CEO Larry Page said that sometimes when Musk visited Silicon Valley, he would email Page and say: \"I don't know where to stay tonight. Can I come over?\"\n",
            "Musk's prerecorded interview comes after he spoke with Anderson live at a TED conference on April 15, and addressed the ongoing saga that is his attempted buyout of Twitter. \n",
            "Musk said that he had a backup plan in the event that Twitter rejects his $43 billion bid, but declined to share any details. \n",
            "During the live event, Musk said that it's possible he may not be able to acquire the company, but said he could \"technically\" afford it.\n",
            "\"I have sufficient assets,\" he said, without giving further details. Most of Musk's personal fortune is tied up in his stake in Tesla.\n",
            "Musk is in for a fight. On Friday, Twitter said it would adopt a \"poison pill\" defense. Insider's Gabrielle Bienasz reported that this \"essentially devalues each share in a company by increasing the total number of shares — making it harder for any person or group to acquire all of a company's stock.\"\n",
            "In the prerecorded interview, Anderson asked how upset Musk was with comments about him and other billionaires as being too wealthy.\n",
            "\"I mean, at this point, it's water off a duck's back,\" Musk said.\n",

            "Throughout the Trump administration, TIME was hailed for its controversial photos showing a chaotic scandal-plagued White House, often depicting President Trump in an unflattering manner. Their covers often insinuated Trump was controlled by Russian President Vladimir Putin. This differs from their recent cover that depicted President Biden in a positive light regarding Russia; several months prior to Russia's invasion into Ukraine, Biden met with Putin in which TIME's cover illustration featured Biden in his signature aviator shades with the headline, \"Taking on Putin.\" \n",

Beinoff is vocal in his support for Democrats and has used his company to protest Republicans. In 2015, Beinoff announced Salesforce would cancel any company travel to Indiana over opposition to their religious freedom bill. Beinoff claimed the bill was discriminatory towards the LGBT community. After Texas passed an anti-abortion bill, Beinoff said his company would pay for any employees in the state to relocate. \n",

            "The Response To Elon Musk Wanting To Protect Free Speech Is Disturbing\n",
            "The response to Elon Musk wanting to buy Twitter, open-source its algorithm, and protect free speech is uncannily disturbing.\n",
            "Before I share why I feel this way, I want to focus more on why Elon wants to buy Twitter, the problem he sees that is worth solving, the reaction of Twitter, the media, and the manufactured outrage — and why this problem is disconcerting.\n",
            "Why Does Elon Want To Buy Twitter Exactly?\n",
            "Elon Musk shared a lot of details during his TED Talks interview with Chris Anderson. Anderson asked Elon why he made the offer to buy Twitter. Elon said,\n",
            "“Well, I think it’s very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech”\n",
            "“Twitter has become kind of the de facto town square. It’s really important that people have both the reality and the perception that they’re able to speak freely within the bounds of the law.”\n",
            "“One of the things that I believe Twitter should do is open source the algorithm and make any changes to peoples’ tweets if they’re emphasized or de-emphasized, that action should be made apparent so anyone can see that action has been taken. There’s no sort of behind-the-scenes manipulation either algorithmically or manually.”\n",
            "In other words, if Twitter is promoting a tweet or hiding your tweets, everyone can see the actions Twitter is taking to do so. This would enable users to see behind-the-scenes how Twitter is shadowbanning and using its algorithm to either suppress voices or amplify them.\n",
            "When asked why he wants to do it, Elon emphasized the importance of Twitter as a function of democracy and free speech.\n",
            "“It’s important to the function of democracy. It’s important to the function of the United States as a free country and many other countries and actually to help freedom in the world more broadly than in the U.S. I think the civilizational risk is decreased the more we can increase the trust of Twitter as a public platform.”\n",
            "Twitter’s Response\n",
            "Twitter’s response is a ‘poison pill’ and from what I’ve seen, the amplification of manufactured outrage and narrative of Elon Musk as a supervillain.\n",
            "On April 14, Saudi Prince, Al Waleed bin Talal Al Saud tweeted from his account that he rejected Elon Musk’s offer to buy Twitter. To which Elon Musk asked two questions:\n",
            "How much of Twitter does the Kingdom own, directly and indirectly?\n",
            "What are the Kingdom’s views on journalistic freedom of speech?\n",
            "The fact that members of the Saudia Arabian royal family own Twitter is something that the media as an industry along with the talking heads are refusing to address.\n",
            "If you’re not familiar with censorship in Saudia Arabia or how they kill journalists, I suggest you do some research. Here and here are two great places to start.\n",
            "Why Is Twitter Fighting So Hard Against Elon Musk?\n",
            "It does seem as if Twitter is fighting against free speech here. For a possible answer as to why, let’s look at this 2020 MIT Technology Review interview with Twitter’s current CEO, Parag Agrawal.\n",
            "In this interview, Gideon Lichfield asked Agrawal how Twitter is balancing combatting misinformation and protecting free speech as a core value as well as the First Amendment here in the US.\n",
            "Agrawal said:\n",
            "“Our role is not to be bound by the First Amendment, but our role is to serve a healthy public conversation and our moves are reflective of things that we believe lead to a healthier public conversation. The kinds of things that we do about this is, focus less on thinking about free speech, but thinking about how the times have changed. One of the changes today that we see is speech is easy on the internet. Most people can speak. Where our role is particularly emphasized is who can be heard. The scarce commodity today is attention. There’s a lot of content out there. A lot of tweets out there, not all of it gets attention, some subset of it gets attention. And so increasingly our role is moving towards how we recommend content and that sort of, is, is, a struggle that we’re working through in terms of how we make sure these recommendation systems that we’re building, how we direct people’s attention is leading to a healthy public conversation that is most participatory.”\n",
            "And take note of that part where Agrawal said that Twitter’s role is particularly emphasizing who can be heard and what the scarce commodity is. The recommendation system that Twitter’s building is its algorithm. It’s how they direct our attention to topics and tweets.\n",
            "The Manufactured Outrage\n",
            "By manufactured outrage, I’m referring to the countless headlines, articles, and tweets by talking heads that create the narrative of ‘Elon Musk Supervillain.’\n",
            "Let’s look at a comparison between how Business Insider reacted to Jeff Bezos buying The Washington Post in 2013 to Elon Musk’s offer for Twitter in 2022.\n",
            "The tweet below was shared in 2013 when Amazon’s Jeff Bezos bought The Washington Post. Considering how everyone hates billionaires, you would think there would be outrage.\n",
            "Link to Tweet\n",
            "When Jeff Bezos bought The Washington Post, it was hailed as a “fascinating cultural transition in America.”\n",
            "Now a look at a recent tweet from Business Insider regarding Elon Musk’s wanting to buy Twitter and make it a better platform for free speech.\n",
            "Link to Tweet\n",
            "The difference is stark and in addition to that, they used a still of Elon Musk — probably taken from a video of him speaking — and photoshopped it. The yellow background makes him pop and the Twitter logo in the birdcage being held by Elon sends a powerful message. The message they are insinuating is that Elon wants to silence your voices.\n",
            "That by supporting free speech, Elon wants to take yours away.\n",
            "This is a false and highly misleading narrative and it’s simply untrue.\n",
            "Something I’ve Noticed\n",
            "I’m a user of Twitter myself and I support Elon Musk and his visions. And I’ve seen a lot of trolls, bots, and even cyberbullying activity taking place on Twitter.\n",
            "A lot of the trolls and bots are spamming replies with misinformation and outright lies: the diamond mine myths, the emerald mine myths, the ‘Elon owns African slaves’ myths, and more.\n",
            "All of these lies have been debunked countless times yet they are still widespread to the point that it’s not just on Twitter, but embedded within the minds and hearts of individuals.\n",
            "In the similar vein that some Trump supporters actually believed that Michelle Obama is a man named Michael, some people actually believe that Elon Musk owns slaves in Africa and is profiting from the diamond or emerald industry.\n",
            "And when you present research and factual evidence that this is not the case, you get called a bootlicker or other crude names. Side note, the fact that any group of people can be so easily manipulated by the media industry into thinking Mrs. Obama is a man or that Elon Musk owns African slaves should frighten you.\n",
            "One thing I’ve noticed is that several of these accounts spamming with misinformation these things in common:\n",
            "Under 100 followers\n",
            "Newly opened accounts\n",
            "Consistent spamming\n",
            "I’m not bashing people with low follower counts here but I am pointing out these are most likely bots and/or troll farms. And yes, some of these accounts are real accounts but you can easily spot that by observing their tweeting behaviors.\n",
            "Then there are the crypto scammers. I find it odd how they can easily get verified on Twitter and impersonate Elon Musk as well as other verified accounts, yet Twitter is quick to suspend a regular person for no reason. That happened to me in 2020 after Elon replied about sending ventilators to Louisiana during the Covid-19 pandemic 2020.\n",
            "It was a horrible feeling losing my account. I felt as if my voice was silenced. I had to use my other account but still, it was hard. After several months, Twitter reinstated my account and I was verified the following spring.\n",
            "Elon Is Right To Protect Free Speech\n",
            "Why are journalists outraged over Elon Musk wanting to protect free speech but are seemingly fine with a Saudi prince owning Twitter? I would think that journalists, in general, would be more outraged over the killing of journalists in Saudi Arabia, and the suppression of free speech, and would agree with Elon Musk.\n",
            "It’s an ominous sign of our times that Elon is being vilified for protecting free speech. It’s revealing that Twitter hasn’t yet solved its problems with the bots, crypto scammers, and the manipulation of its algorithm. And when someone who does want to solve these problems makes an offer, Twitter issues a poison pill.\n",
            "Instead of asking this question: Why Is Twitter Fighting So Hard Against Free Speech and Open-Sourcing Its Algorithm?, the mainstream media is pushing this narrative of Elon Musk as the supervillain.\n",

            "Every private company with a social media platform has the right to its Terms of Service which are clear about the content allowed on its site. The First Amendment protects each company’s enforcement of its TOS from government repercussions. When you log onto the platform, you sign a contract to adhere to these Terms of Service. Many people have said to Musk that Twitter only suspends Conservatives for free speech. Being on both sides of the political spectrum, I have seen people from both sides suspended for violating Twitter’s Term of Service. Elon Musk and Republicans want to make a pathway for anything on Twitter without repercussions.\n",

No enforcement of Terms of Service could have a disastrous effect on people’s well-being and even the country’s. There would be no stopping it because, according to them, it’s considered “free speech.” This will divide our country even more. There is also a possibility of the reinstatement of Donald Trump’s Twitter account.

            "\"Having a public platform that is trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization,\" Musk elaborated during a TED Talk on Thursday, per Deadline. \"I don’t care about the economics at all.\" He also acknowledged he may not be able to buy it, but that he has a \"Plan B\" should that prove the case.\n",

            "She argued that thanks to Twitter deciding what content is and isn't okay to share on its platform, \"we're not getting open debate ... any longer.\" Instead, she argued, it's just \"what they think is politically correct.\"\n",
            "\"That has to stop because I don’t think we can grow as a nation and grow in ideas when we’re totally being censored by Big Tech,\" Jenner continued. \"And it’s got to stop.\"\n",

The conservative relationship with Twitter soured considerably after former president Donald Trump was suspended multiple times and ultimately banned from the platform while still in office in January 2021.\n",
            "Conservatives continue to lash out against Twitter and other social media platforms for flagging content labeled misinformation about such topics as Covid, the January 6 insurrection and even the 2020 election Trump insisted was stolen from him.\n",
            "According to TMZ, Twitter's response is that its board of directors will review his offer -- which comes in higher than its current trading value -- and make the decision that's in the \"best interest\" of the company and its stockholders.\n",
            "But Musk isn't happy with that, either, later tweeting, \"It would be utterly indefensible not to put this offer to a shareholder vote. They own the company, not the board of directors.\"\n",

            "Michael Stipe\n",
            "On Thursday, ten days after revealing his 9.2 percent stake in Twitter to the public, Elon Musk delivered an ultimatum: either the board accept his offer to buy the company for $43 billion and take it private, or he’d “reconsider” his position as a shareholder. Such an acquisition could have huge implications for how we communicate online, and the entire affair presents troubling questions about the power Musk is able to exert over our society.\n",
            "For all its problems, Twitter is central to cultural and political life in the United States and beyond, and Musk has long been one of its most prominent users. He wields it to preach to his adoring supporters, slam his critics, manipulate financial markets, and provide the media with fodder for endless clickbait. But his attempt to use his power to capture Twitter and reshape it for his own ends is serious cause for concern.\n",
            "What Is in Elon Musk’s Head?\n",
            "Despite the recent revelation of Musk’s stake in the company, he’s been buying shares since the end of January. In March, he began publicly criticizing the company for supposedly limiting free speech. Musk adopted this language from the right-wing provocateurs he’s increasingly associating himself with, but neither truly care about free speech: they just want speech that better serves their interests. Musk himself has a history of slandering his critics, getting impersonators banned from Twitter, firing employees who disagreed with his ideas, and even reportedly having a whistleblower framed as a mass shooter.\n",
            "Hours after his proposal to buy Twitter was announced, Musk appeared onstage at the TED conference in Vancouver. When asked about his intentions for Twitter and its approach to moderation, he gave a very conflicting answer. On the one hand, he presented a vision of Twitter that would be something akin to Gab or Parler, supposed havens of free speech that are more like right-wing cesspools. On the other, he said human moderators could decide what’s acceptable and that the platform should try to eliminate bots and spammers.\n",
            "Musk claims that buying Twitter is about protecting a virtual public square that is essential for democracy. Yet social media platforms have proven better at amplifying the perspectives of white nationalists and outright fascists than providing a level playing field for reasoned conversation. With his own distorted conception of free speech, why should we expect a Musk-led Twitter to do any better?\n",
            "At the same time, all this assumes that Musk actually wants to buy Twitter. Yes, he’s submitted an offer and claims he wants to purchase. But Musk is a serial liar who frequently engages in publicity stunts for media attention. One need only think back to the 2018 “funding secured” tweet, where Musk claimed to have the money to take Tesla private. That proved to be untrue — the beginning of his ongoing feud with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n",
            "In the case of Twitter, Musk’s efforts are already running into trouble and the structure of the acquisition offer suggests it could be a way out of this whole misguided affair. Musk is facing a shareholder lawsuit because he was supposed to report his position in the company by March 24 — ten days after hitting a 5 percent ownership stake — but didn’t do so until April 4, meaning shareholders potentially lost out on over $100 million. SEC action on that front could still be coming. Twitter employees are seemingly also angry over his attempt to take over the company, and given that Twitter’s share price fell after Musk’s acquisition offer was made public, investors don’t seem to be taking it seriously.\n",
            "For one, Musk doesn’t have the $43 billion on hand for the purchase. He’d either need to sell a significant chunk of Tesla shares — which could sink its inflated valuation — or borrow even more against them. Further, while Musk’s offer of $54.20 a share is above Twitter’s current price, it was much higher than that last year, and investors feel Musk’s offer is too low to be taken seriously. But in his offer letter, Musk claims it’s his “best and final” offer, “a high price and your shareholders will love it,” and if it’s not taken, “I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder.”\n",
            "It’s impossible to get inside Musk’s head to know what he’s thinking — I’m not sure I’d even want a peek at what goes on in there. There’s certainly a possibility this is serious, and that his offer letter is a display of hubris by a man with virtually limitless wealth and few people around to contradict him. But there’s also a chance this has already gone wrong and he’s getting tired of it, so he’s presented an offer he knows the board will reject that will allow him to say he was turned down. And in the meantime, he can keep railing against the platform, instead of backing off with his tail between his legs.\n",
            "The Myth of Musk\n",
            "Whatever the outcome, this whole news cycle has further illustrated the unhealthy relationship between the media and the world’s richest man. Elon Musk didn’t emerge out of nowhere. The myth of the man and the idea that he is a visionary leading us into the future was constructed by the media, creating a mutually beneficial relationship where Musk got glowing coverage, allowing him to do virtually anything he wanted, and the media got an inspiring figure that sold magazines and attracted readers.\n",
            "But as Musk has taken the turn from liberal darling solving the climate crisis to billionaire oligarch doing whatever he wants — whether slamming calls for higher taxes on the uber-rich to calling for the end of subsidies that were essential to his own companies’ success — the media’s continued obsession with him has become unhealthy to the point of being corrosive to democracy.\n",
            "If we think about the ideal means of governing a platform like Twitter, it wouldn’t be rule by the world’s richest man. Certainly, having some regulations by representative governments could help, but in a truly democratic society, it would be governed by users, workers, and other stakeholders.\n",
            "Yet the media’s endless headlines about Musk’s every action leave us constantly centering his vision for how our society should be run. That leaves us precious little time to ponder whether a figure like Elon Musk should be able to exist — and own a social media platform — at all.\n",
